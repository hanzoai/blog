# ䷵ Guī Mèi — The Integration: Adapters and Bridges

Thunder above, lake below. Movement and joy meeting — but not as primary equals. The I-Ching describes a union that is real but requires care: it is not a union of identical things but of different things brought into relationship. The outcome depends on how well the relationship is structured.

Integration between heterogeneous systems is exactly this. Systems with different data models, different API conventions, different consistency guarantees, different failure semantics — these systems are not naturally compatible. They can be made to interoperate through deliberate translation. The adapter is the translation layer.

## When You Need an Adapter

You need an adapter when two systems need to exchange data or coordinate behavior but were not designed to do so directly. The canonical examples:

- An existing application built around REST needs to integrate with a gRPC service
- A Python ML pipeline needs to exchange tensors with a Go serving layer
- An old database schema needs to serve a new application that expects a different data shape
- Two AI models need to be used in a pipeline where the output format of one is not the input format of the other

In each case, the correct solution is an explicit translation layer — not a hack that coerces one system to speak the other's language directly (which usually breaks future changes to either system) but a defined interface that translates between them.

## The Adapter Pattern

The adapter pattern is one of the oldest in software design: define an interface that your code needs, implement an adapter that satisfies that interface by calling the external system, use only the adapter in your code.

This does three things:

First, it makes the external dependency explicit. You know exactly what your code uses from the external system — it is the adapter's interface. You can audit it. You can mock it in tests.

Second, it isolates change. When the external system changes its API, you update the adapter. Your core code does not change.

Third, it enables replacement. If you need to swap the external system for a different one, you write a new adapter that implements the same interface. The rest of the system is unchanged.

The Hanzo inference gateway uses this pattern for model providers. Each provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, local models, Hanzo-hosted models) has an adapter that translates between the provider's native API and the gateway's internal model. The routing layer does not know which provider is serving a request — it knows only the adapter interface. New providers are added by writing new adapters, not by modifying the routing logic.

## Integration as First-Class Engineering

Integration work is often treated as secondary — not "real" engineering, but glue. This is wrong in two ways.

First, the quality of integration directly determines whether the integrated whole is reliable. A system whose components are individually reliable but whose integration layer is poorly tested and fragile will fail at the integration points. The most common production incidents are integration failures: the contract between systems was violated, and the violation was not caught.

Second, well-designed integration points outlast the systems they connect. The adapter that translates between your application and your database version 11 will be updated for version 12, version 13, and whatever comes after. The adapter's design — how well it isolates the application from database specifics — determines the maintenance cost of every future upgrade.

Zoo Labs research infrastructure treats integration layers as first-class artifacts. They are tested as thoroughly as the components they connect. They are documented with their own specification. Their interfaces are versioned independently.

## The Fragile Union

Guī Mèi's warning is about unions that are not properly structured. A relationship built on assumption rather than explicit agreement is fragile. The same applies to integration: implicit contracts (undocumented behavior that both systems accidentally depend on) are the source of the most difficult production failures to diagnose.

Make the contract explicit. Write it down. Test it. When one side changes, the test suite tells you the contract was violated.

Thunder above the lake. The union is real. Make it durable.
