# Bitcoin and Commerce: An Experiment in Crypto Payments (2013)

In January 2013, Bitcoin was trading at $13. Most people in tech thought it was either a fraud or a curiosity. A small group believed it was the future of internet money. We weren't sure which camp was right — so we integrated it and found out.

## Why We Did It

The existing payment rails for global commerce were broken in ways that were obvious if you were building for international markets. Credit card acceptance varied dramatically by country. Chargebacks were a tax on merchants, especially in digital goods. Cross-border transactions had fees embedded in the exchange rate that were invisible to customers but real to merchants.

Bitcoin's value proposition was clear: global, instant, irreversible, low-fee. The volatility was a real problem. But the underlying protocol was technically elegant and the adoption curve was not zero.

We added Bitcoin as a payment option to the Hanzo Commerce platform. Not as a feature — as an experiment.

## What We Learned

**Settlement was the hard part.** Accepting Bitcoin was easy. Deciding when to convert to fiat and at what rate was a business problem with no clean solution in 2013. Hold too long and volatility erased margins. Convert immediately and you needed real-time exchange infrastructure.

**The audience was real but small.** A meaningful fraction of our clients' customers preferred Bitcoin, particularly in digital goods and technology products. The preference was strong enough that offering it produced measurable conversion lift for certain audiences.

**Irreversibility is a feature.** In digital goods commerce, chargebacks are a persistent fraud vector. Irreversible payments eliminate that attack surface entirely. This was worth significant money to merchants.

## The Foundation for Everything After

The 2013 Bitcoin experiment gave us the domain knowledge that made our blockchain work credible later. When the ICO era arrived in 2017-2018 and projects like Unikoin Gold needed technical guidance on token economics and smart contract design, we had five years of first-hand experience with crypto payment infrastructure.

The crypto bet in 2013 looked premature. By 2018 it looked prescient.
