# ML-Powered Analytics: From Dashboards to Decisions

Dashboards are necessary but insufficient. They tell you what happened. They do not tell you what to do. Today we are launching ML-powered analytics that bridge the gap.

## The Dashboard Problem

Traditional analytics require:

1. Human notices something in dashboard
2. Human investigates the anomaly
3. Human identifies root cause
4. Human decides on action
5. Human implements change

Each step introduces delay. Each handoff risks the insight being lost. By the time action happens, the moment may have passed.

## Automated Insight Detection

Hanzo now continuously analyzes your data for:

### Anomalies

Statistical models learn your normal patterns. Deviations trigger alerts:

- "Conversion rate dropped 34% in the last hour, primarily from mobile traffic in Germany"
- "Average order value increased 28% this week, driven by new customers purchasing bundles"

### Trends

Time-series forecasting identifies emerging patterns:

- "At current growth rate, you will exceed inventory for SKU-123 in 18 days"
- "Customer acquisition cost is trending up 5% month-over-month"

### Opportunities

Pattern recognition finds untapped potential:

- "Customers who view product A but do not purchase convert 3x better when shown product B"
- "Email campaigns sent Tuesday morning outperform other times by 22%"

## From Insight to Action

Detection is half the problem. Hanzo now suggests specific actions:

**Anomaly detected**: Mobile conversion dropped
**Root cause**: New iOS version causing checkout issues
**Suggested action**: Enable iOS-specific fallback flow
**One-click**: Apply fix

**Opportunity detected**: Bundle potential
**Evidence**: Co-purchase patterns in data
**Suggested action**: Create bundle with 15% discount
**One-click**: Create bundle

## Implementation

The system architecture:

1. **Data pipeline**: Real-time event streaming
2. **Feature store**: Precomputed metrics for fast analysis
3. **Model zoo**: Anomaly detection, forecasting, classification models
4. **Insight engine**: Generates natural language explanations
5. **Action engine**: Maps insights to platform capabilities

## Customization

Every business is different. You can:

- Adjust sensitivity thresholds
- Define custom anomaly rules
- Prioritize certain metrics
- Create custom actions

## Results

Early access merchants report:

- 67% faster response to issues
- 41% increase in identified opportunities
- 3.2 hours saved per week on analysis

## Privacy and Control

All analysis happens on your data, in your account. No data is shared between merchants. You can disable any analysis type.

## What's Next

We are working on:

- Automated experimentation (test suggested changes automatically)
- Cross-merchant benchmarking (opt-in, anonymized)
- Natural language queries ("Why did revenue drop last Tuesday?")

Analytics should not just show what happened. They should help you decide what to do next.
