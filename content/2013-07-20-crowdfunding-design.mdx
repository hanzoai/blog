# Designing for Pre-Sales: The Crowdfunding Commerce Playbook

Pre-sale commerce is a different purchase psychology from retail. You are not selling a product the customer can receive today — you are selling a promise, a vision, and an opportunity. The design patterns that convert in retail do not transfer directly.

By 2013, we had run enough crowdfunding campaigns on the Hanzo platform to have real data on what worked. Here is what we found.

## The Hierarchy of Persuasion

Pre-sale conversion follows a different hierarchy than retail:

**1. Credibility first.** Who is making this? Do they have a track record? In retail, brand recognition handles this. In crowdfunding, you are often unknown. The campaign must establish credibility before making any pitch.

**2. Problem clarity second.** The visitor must understand the problem being solved before they care about the solution. Campaigns that led with the product failed. Campaigns that led with the problem converted.

**3. Solution differentiation third.** Why this solution? Why not an existing product? The differentiation must be demonstrable — video, comparison tables, technical specifications — not just claimed.

**4. Social proof fourth.** Who else believes in this? Backer counts, press coverage, expert endorsements — these convert fence-sitters.

**5. Urgency last.** Scarcity and time pressure only work when the visitor already wants the product. Leading with urgency for a product they haven't decided they want creates distrust.

## The Design System

We built the Hanzo crowdfunding templates around this hierarchy. The page structure was optimized for the psychological sequence — not for "above the fold" logic from media advertising.

Key design decisions:
- **Founder video** at the top, 60-90 seconds, problem-first narrative
- **Trust signals** (press, advisors, technical specs) immediately after
- **Social proof** (backer count, external validation) visible throughout
- **Urgency elements** (campaign timer, quantity limits) after the visitor had seen the full pitch

The conversion improvement over unstructured campaign pages was significant. The psychological sequence was not intuitive — designers consistently wanted to put the product hero shot at the top. The data was consistent: problem-first outperformed product-first.

## What We Learned About AI and Persuasion

The crowdfunding optimization work was our first serious application of behavioral data to UI design. The A/B test results generated the training data. The patterns we found empirically — problem-first, credibility before urgency, social proof placement — were the human intuition-override cases that only data could reveal.

This informed the generative AI applications we'd build in 2015: when we started automating campaign copy, the first training data was the high-converting campaigns from 2012-2014.
