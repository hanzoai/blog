# Cover Build: 300% More Qualified Leads for Prefab Housing

The word "prefab" has a preconception problem. Decades of manufactured housing that prioritized cost over quality left people with an image of flimsy construction and generic design. Cover Build was building the opposite: precision-engineered, fully customizable prefabricated homes with quality that exceeded conventional construction.

The challenge was communicating that difference before a prospective customer dismissed the product category entirely.

## Cover's Product

Cover built homes in a controlled factory environment using digital fabrication. Because the manufacturing process was precise and weather-protected, tolerances were tighter than site-built construction. Materials didn't warp on a job site. Joints were more accurate. The result was a better-built home than most site construction — delivered faster and at more predictable cost.

But "prefab" wasn't the word that communicated any of that.

## The Website as Sales Tool

For Cover, the website was doing the work that a showroom would do for a conventional homebuilder. Buyers couldn't walk a model home; they had to understand the product through pixels.

We rebuilt Cover's digital presence around three objectives:

**Show the precision.** The quality advantage was real but invisible in photographs of finished homes. We used 3D visualization to make the construction process itself visible — showing the factory fabrication, the modular assembly, the tolerance quality. Making the "how" visible made the "why it's better" legible.

**Enable customization online.** Cover's product was customizable — floor plans, finishes, layouts. We built an interactive visualization tool that let prospective buyers configure their home and see what it would look like. 70% of buyers who converted had spent significant time in the configurator before engaging with the sales team.

**Shorten the sales cycle.** Prefab homes required buyers to understand a purchasing and construction process different from conventional homebuilding. We built content and automation that walked buyers through the process proactively — answering the questions that would have otherwise required multiple sales calls.

## Results

- **300% increase in qualified leads**
- **40% reduction in sales cycle** from first contact to deposit
- **70% of converting customers** used the visualization tools
- Customer satisfaction scores improved significantly on post-purchase surveys measuring understanding of the process
