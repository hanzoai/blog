# Hanzo Visor: Cloud Infrastructure and VM Management

Running AI at scale requires compute infrastructure that can grow from a single GPU to a fleet of H100s without changing how you manage it. Hanzo Visor provides that unified control plane.

## What Visor Manages

**Virtual machines.** Provision, configure, and manage VMs across compute tiers — from cost-optimized CPU instances for inference to GPU clusters for training. SSH access, cloud-init configuration, and lifecycle management from a single interface.

**Kubernetes clusters.** Visor deploys and manages Kubernetes clusters on Hanzo's infrastructure. Scale the control plane and worker nodes independently. Persistent volumes backed by Hanzo's distributed storage.

**Networks and security groups.** Define network topology, configure ingress rules, and manage private networking between services. VPC-style isolation for multi-tenant deployments.

**Storage.** Block storage for VMs, object storage for model weights and datasets, and network-attached volumes for shared workloads. Replicated across availability zones.

## Built for AI Workloads

Visor includes profiles optimized for common AI deployment patterns:

- **Inference clusters**: Auto-scaled GPU pools with load balancing across model replicas
- **Training jobs**: Spot instance scheduling for cost-efficient training runs
- **Embedding pipelines**: CPU-optimized instances for batch embedding at scale
- **Fine-tuning environments**: Persistent GPU instances with attached NVMe storage

The Visor API integrates with Hanzo's MLOps tooling — model deployments, experiment tracking, and serving infrastructure — making compute management part of the AI development workflow rather than a separate operations concern.
