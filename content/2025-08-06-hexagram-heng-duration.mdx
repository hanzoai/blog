# ䷟ Héng — Duration: Infrastructure That Outlasts

Thunder above, wind below. Not a single explosive event but continuous, maintained movement in the same direction. The thirty-second hexagram is about duration — the property of things that persist. Not because they are unchanging, but because they adapt continuously while maintaining their essential nature.

The internet is Héng. It has changed enormously since its original design: the topology, the hardware, the applications built on it. But the core protocols — TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP — persist because they solved real problems in minimal ways that left room for everything built on top to evolve.

This is the standard for infrastructure. Not whether it is fashionable. Whether it will still be necessary in ten years.

## The Hype Cycle Problem

Technology hype cycles are real and expensive. Blockchain for everything (2017-2018). Kubernetes for everything (2019-2020). Serverless for everything (2020-2021). Microservices for everything (2016-2019). AI for everything (2023-present).

Each cycle produces real technology with real applications and a massive overshoot in adoption — teams applying the technology to problems it doesn't solve, building infrastructure they don't need, accumulating operational complexity they cannot maintain.

The filter for whether to adopt a technology is not "is this exciting" or "is this being written about." It is: does this solve a problem I actually have, is the solution better than what I'm already using, and is the operational complexity worth the benefit?

Héng asks: will this still be here and necessary in five years? Technologies that answer yes to that question are candidates for infrastructure. Technologies that don't are candidates for applications.

## What Lasts

The technologies that have lasted in computing share common properties:

**They solve real problems**: DNS solves the real problem that you cannot ask humans to remember IP addresses and that IP addresses change. HTTP solves the real problem of exchanging documents over a network. git solves the real problem of distributed version control with branching. These are not manufactured problems.

**They are minimal**: The core protocol is as small as possible. Extension mechanisms exist but the core is stable. You can implement a conforming TCP stack, or an HTTP server, or a git compatible remote from the specification without reading the reference implementation's source code.

**They are documented**: The specification is public, precise, and complete enough to implement against. Proprietary implementations of public specifications can compete on quality without the specification being closed.

**They compose**: DNS composes with HTTP. HTTP composes with TLS. TLS composes with X.509. The protocols were designed with their composition surface in mind.

**They don't require a vendor**: Using DNS doesn't require a commercial relationship with the DNS inventors. Using HTTP doesn't require a license from Tim Berners-Lee. The technology is available to anyone who implements the specification.

## The Hanzo Long Game

Hanzo has been building commerce infrastructure since 2008. That context shapes how infrastructure decisions are made: is this something we will still be running in 2035? If yes, build it correctly. If no, buy it or use a managed service.

The payment processing abstraction, the analytics pipeline, the identity layer — these are things Hanzo will still be running in 2035 because commerce requires them and they are core to the product's value. They get the investment: correct data models, extensive tests, careful interface design, investment in documentation.

The AI inference infrastructure — which models are available, which inference engines are used, which hardware is targeted — will look very different in 2035. The interface that the application layer uses to call models should be stable. The implementation behind that interface will evolve.

This is the architectural expression of Héng: the interface that lasts is stable; the implementation behind it adapts to conditions. The interface is the thunder — continuous, maintained movement. The implementation is the wind — responsive, adapting, but directed.

## Duration Through Openness

The deepest durability principle in the Hanzo ecosystem: open source and open protocols are more durable than closed ones. A closed source system's continuity depends on its creator's commercial success. An open source system's continuity depends on whether it is useful — which is a much more reliable durability criterion.

Linux has outlasted every proprietary operating system of its era. TCP/IP has outlasted every proprietary networking stack of its era. The open web has outlasted every proprietary content platform of its era (though the contest continues).

The Lux protocol, the Zen model weights, the MCP specification, the Zoo open research network: these are built to outlast Hanzo AI as a company. The protocols continue as long as they are useful. The company is the steward, not the owner.

Thunder above, wind below. Continuous movement. Build the thing that will still be here when the current hype has passed.
