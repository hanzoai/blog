# The Agency That Ate Its Own Cooking: From Services to Infrastructure

Verus Media — the agency we'd been running since 2013 — had a distinctive property by 2017: every major engagement used Hanzo infrastructure. Commerce on Hanzo Commerce. Analytics on Track.js. AI optimization through the recommendation and copy generation stack. Dashboards through Dash.js.

We had been building the tools we needed to do excellent agency work, and then productizing those tools. The feedback loop between service delivery and product development was the most efficient research and development process we could have designed.

## The Compounding

A client would come in with a specific problem: "We need to convert better on our product pages." We'd analyze the behavioral data, build a hypothesis, and test it using the A/B framework we'd built for exactly this purpose. The test results would improve the client's conversion. The test data would improve the Hanzo ML models. The improved models would make the next engagement better.

After five years of this cycle, the Hanzo stack had been trained and hardened by hundreds of real commercial campaigns across dozens of categories. It wasn't software developed by engineers who had never run a campaign — it was software developed by practitioners who had to rely on it for client results.

## What Techstars Confirmed

When we went through Techstars in the summer of 2017, the mentors who had scaled enterprise SaaS products kept asking the same question: "What makes your models better than a client building this themselves?"

The answer was the agency history: 50 clients' worth of campaign data. The recommendation engine that had been trained on outdoor gear campaigns and crowdfunding electronics and DTC health brands. The copy generation model trained on tens of thousands of subject lines with attached click rates. The fraud detection model trained on transaction patterns from merchants in twelve categories.

No individual brand could accumulate that breadth of training data. The agency-to-product pipeline was, by 2017, a significant competitive asset.

## The Transition

After Techstars, the balance shifted. More revenue came from platform subscriptions than from agency services. The agency work continued — and continued to generate valuable training data — but the operational model was moving toward product.

The SKULLY engagement. The Unikrn engagement. Bellabeat. KANOA. Each one still had an agency component — strategy, design, execution. Each one also ran on Hanzo infrastructure and contributed data back to the models.

By 2019, the agency was the R&D arm of a product company. That's what it had been designed to become.
