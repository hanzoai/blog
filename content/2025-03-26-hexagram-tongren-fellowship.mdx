# ䷌ Tóng Rén — Fellowship in the Open

Fire above heaven. The image is light in the open — visible to all, warming all, not hidden in a corner. The thirteenth hexagram specifically contrasts fellowship in the open with clique-fellowship: gathering around a shared purpose in the open is auspicious; gathering in secret, for narrow benefit, is not.

Open source software at its best is Tóng Rén in practice. The code is in the open. The discussions are in the open. The decisions are in the open. The purpose is shared. Anyone who accepts the purpose is welcome.

## What Makes Open Source Work

The naive theory of open source is "anyone can contribute." This is technically true but misses the point. Contribution is not the scarce resource. The scarce resources are: shared understanding of the purpose, the discipline to maintain that purpose under pressure, and the governance that keeps the fellowship genuinely open rather than nominally open.

Shared purpose is the first requirement. A project without a clear, articulated purpose accumulates contributions that pull in different directions. Each contribution is locally rational — the contributor is solving their problem — but globally incoherent. The project becomes a collection of features with no discernible center.

Governance is the second requirement. Who can merge? Who can set direction? When contributors disagree, who decides? Open source projects that avoid answering these questions are not ungoverned — they are governed by whoever has commit access and is most persistent. Explicit governance that is legible to newcomers is more equitable than implicit governance that favors insiders.

## Zoo Labs as Fellowship Infrastructure

The Zoo Labs Foundation is built on this hexagram's principle. Zoo operates as a 501(c)(3) — a nonprofit structure — because the research infrastructure it maintains should not be capturable by any single commercial interest. The open AI research network, the decentralized training infrastructure, the ZIPs (Zoo Improvement Proposals) governance process: all of these are designed for fellowship in the open.

ZIPs are modeled on EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) and BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals): a numbered, public, immutable record of proposed changes, discussion, and decisions. The process is the governance. Anyone can propose. Discussion happens in public. Acceptance requires rough consensus among active contributors.

This is slow compared to a single entity making decisions. It is also more durable: the decisions have legitimacy because they were made through a legible process, and the record of the decision and its rationale is preserved.

## Zen Models as Open Commons

The Zen model family — open-weight models from 0.6B to 1T+ parameters — exists because computation should not be owned. A model whose weights are publicly available is a piece of shared infrastructure. Anyone can run it, fine-tune it, study it, build on it.

This is the difference between a product and commons. A product extracts value by controlling access. Commons creates value by enabling access. The model weights that Zen releases are not generosity — they are a deliberate choice about what kind of AI ecosystem to build. One where capability is a shared resource, not a rent-extracting bottleneck.

Open weights also provide a security guarantee that closed models cannot: you can inspect the weights, run the model, and verify its behavior. You cannot do that with a model accessed through an API. The model provider's word that it behaves a certain way is not a security property. Running it yourself is.

## The Cypherpunk Tradition

The cypherpunk tradition — from which both open source software and open cryptographic protocols emerge — is Tóng Rén with an explicit political dimension. The idea: code is speech, cryptography is power, and technology distributed openly is technology that cannot be monopolized.

PGP, open SSL, the Linux kernel, git — these were all developed in the open because their creators believed that the infrastructure of digital communication should not be owned by any single entity. That belief is not naive — it is a design requirement. Infrastructure that is owned can be withheld, modified against users' interests, or shut down. Infrastructure that is held in common cannot be.

Hanzo operates in the same tradition: open protocols, open weights, open source tools. Not because open source is trendy, but because it is the architecture of trust.

Fire above heaven. Fellowship in the open. This is how durable things are built.
