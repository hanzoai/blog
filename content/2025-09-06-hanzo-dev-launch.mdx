# Hanzo Dev: AI Coding Agent for Your Terminal

Coding assistants that live in the cloud are limited. They don't know your codebase. They can't run your tests. They lose context when you close the tab. They're autocomplete with extra steps.

Today we're launching Hanzo Dev: an AI coding agent for your terminal.

## Not Autocomplete

Hanzo Dev is an agent, not an assistant. It reads your entire codebase, understands the architecture, runs tests, commits code, and iterates until the task is done.

```bash
dev "add rate limiting to the API endpoint, write tests, update the docs"
```

Dev reads your codebase, writes the implementation, runs the tests, fixes any failures, updates the documentation, and proposes a commit. You review and approve.

## Codebase Understanding

Before executing any task, Dev builds a semantic map of your codebase:

- File structure and module dependencies
- Function signatures and type relationships
- Test coverage and patterns
- Recent git history and commit messages
- Documentation and comments

This context persists across sessions. Dev knows your codebase like a senior engineer who's been on the project for months.

## Terminal Native

Dev runs entirely in your terminal. No browser tab. No cloud account required for local operation. No copy-pasting code between windows.

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @hanzo/dev

# Initialize in your project
dev init

# Start working
dev "refactor the authentication module to use JWT"
```

## Multi-Model

Dev routes tasks to the best model:

- **Code generation**: Zen Coder (480B MoE) for complex implementations
- **Quick edits**: Zen Coder Flash (31B MoE, 3B active) for speed
- **Review and analysis**: Zen Max for reasoning-heavy tasks
- **Embeddings**: Zen Embedding for codebase search and retrieval

You can specify the model or let Dev choose based on task complexity.

## MCP Integration

Dev integrates with Hanzo MCP (260+ tools) for tasks beyond code:

- Search documentation and Stack Overflow
- Create GitHub issues and PRs
- Query databases and APIs
- Deploy to staging environments
- Run CI/CD pipelines

## Privacy and Security

Local execution by default. Your code never leaves your machine unless you configure a remote backend. All model API calls are encrypted in transit. We never train on your code.

For enterprises: self-hosted Hanzo Dev with your own model deployment.

## Available Now

Hanzo Dev is available via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @hanzo/dev
```

Free tier: 100 tasks/month. Pro: unlimited at $20/month.
