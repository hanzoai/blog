# Run AI Agents for $5/Month: Introducing Hanzo Bot

Every developer building AI agents is paying three to five different providers. A language model API from one company. Compute from another. Search, storage, and tools from three more. Five bills. Five auth systems. Five points of failure.

Today we're launching [hanzo.bot](https://hanzo.bot) — one platform for building, deploying, and hosting AI agents at prices that undercut every major cloud provider.

## The Pricing

| Plan | Specs | Price | vs DigitalOcean | vs AWS Lightsail |
|------|-------|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Starter** | 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM, 20 GB SSD | **$5/mo** (free credit) | $6/mo | $5/mo |
| **Builder** | 2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, 40 GB SSD | **$10/mo** | $18/mo (**44% less**) | $10/mo |
| **Dev** | 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 25 GB SSD | **$15/mo** | $24/mo for 4 GB (**38% less + 2x RAM**) | $44/mo (**66% less**) |
| **Pro** | 2 ded vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 80 GB SSD | **$25/mo** | $40/mo for 4 GB (**38% less + 2x RAM**) | $44/mo (**43% less**) |
| **Turbo** | 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 160 GB SSD | **$39/mo** | $48/mo for 8 GB (**19% less + 2x RAM**) | $84/mo (**54% less**) |

New accounts get a **$5 credit**, making the Starter tier effectively free for your first month.

Every plan includes DDoS protection, automated backups, IPv4/IPv6, and — critically — **zero egress fees**. Unlike AWS ($0.09/GB), GCP ($0.12/GB), and Azure that charge for outbound bandwidth, Hanzo charges nothing within generous transfer limits.

## Built for Bots, Not Just VMs

Hanzo Bot isn't a rebranded VPS. It's purpose-built for AI agent workloads:

**Integrated AI Gateway** — Call any of 100+ models without separate API accounts. GPT-5, Claude Opus, Gemini, DeepSeek, Llama 4, or our 14 proprietary Zen models — all through one endpoint, one key.

**Built-in Tools** — Web search at $0.005/query. Code interpreter at $0.03/min. File storage at $0.20/GB/mo. Speech-to-text at $0.0009/min — 85% cheaper than OpenAI Whisper.

**GPU On-Demand** — Spin up H100 GPUs at $3.48/hr for ML inference. That's 72% cheaper than AWS. Fine-tune models or run local inference for latency-sensitive agent loops.

**Scale to Enterprise** — 11 compute tiers up to 96 vCPU / 384 GB RAM / 1.9 TB SSD for agent swarms and fleet management. The Ultra tier supports up to 1,000 VMs under a single account.

## The Dev Plan: Our Loss Leader

The Dev plan at $15/month is intentionally aggressive. Two vCPUs, 8 GB RAM, 25 GB SSD, 3 TB transfer. DigitalOcean's closest equivalent gives you half the RAM for 60% more money.

We're betting that developers who start with a $15 Dev plan will scale into our $219–$3,999 dedicated tiers as their agents find product-market fit.
