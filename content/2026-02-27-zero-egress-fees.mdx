# Zero Egress Fees: The Cloud Pricing Practice That Needs to Die

A startup builds a product. It works. Users arrive. Traffic grows. And then the cloud bill arrives — with a line item nobody budgeted for.

Egress fees.

AWS charges $0.09 per gigabyte of outbound data. GCP charges $0.12. Azure charges $0.087. A moderately popular API serving 10 TB of outbound data per month faces an egress bill of $900–$1,200 — on top of compute, on top of storage, on top of everything else.

Egress fees are a tax on success. The more users you get, the more you pay to serve them. We think that's backwards.

## Hanzo Network: Zero Egress

Every Hanzo Network plan includes generous bandwidth with no overage charges:

| Plan | Price | Transfer Included |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Starter | $5/mo | 500 GB |
| Builder | $10/mo | 1 TB |
| Dev | $15/mo | 3 TB |
| Pro | $25/mo | 2 TB |
| Turbo | $39/mo | 4 TB |
| Turbo Dedicated | $49/mo | 4 TB |
| Business | $219/mo | 20 TB |
| Enterprise | $429/mo | 40 TB |
| Scale | $849/mo | 50 TB |
| Mega | $1,299/mo | 60 TB |
| Ultra | $3,999/mo | 120 TB |

No per-GB overage charges. No surprise line items.

## The Hidden Cost of Egress

Let's make this concrete. A SaaS company running on AWS with:
- 20 TB outbound data/month
- Standard egress pricing ($0.09/GB for first 10 TB, $0.085 for next 40 TB)

**Monthly egress bill: ~$1,620**

That's $19,440/year just for the privilege of sending data to your users. Not compute. Not storage. Just bandwidth.

On Hanzo Network's Enterprise plan ($429/mo), that same 20 TB is included. The Enterprise plan costs $5,148/year total — for compute, storage, bandwidth, DDoS protection, and backups combined.

## "But DigitalOcean Doesn't Charge Egress Either"

Partially true. DigitalOcean includes bandwidth allowances with droplets and charges $0.01/GB for overages — much better than AWS. But:

1. DigitalOcean charges $0.10/GB for block storage (Hanzo: $0.08/GB)
2. DigitalOcean charges $4/mo for reserved IPv4 addresses (Hanzo: included)
3. DigitalOcean charges 20% of droplet price for automated backups (Hanzo: included)
4. DigitalOcean's General Purpose 32 vCPU / 128 GB costs $960/mo (Hanzo: $849)

When you add up the hidden costs, Hanzo is meaningfully cheaper even against the "developer-friendly" clouds.

## Consistent Global Pricing

AWS charges different egress rates by region. Data transfer from Asia Pacific costs more than US East. Cross-region transfer within AWS costs $0.01–0.02/GB even between your own services.

Hanzo Network charges the same price in all four regions: US East, US West, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Your Singapore deployment costs exactly the same as your Virginia deployment.

## Why We Can Do This

We route traffic through cost-optimized backend infrastructure across multiple providers, selecting the best-margin option per region while maintaining consistent customer-facing pricing. The details of our provider routing are internal — what matters to you is the price on the invoice.

## The Bet

We're betting that developers will choose the cloud that doesn't punish growth. Build your product, find your users, scale your traffic — your bandwidth is included.
