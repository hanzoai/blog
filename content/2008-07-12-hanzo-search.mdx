# Hanzo Search: Full-Text Discovery Built for Commerce

Search is different from browsing. A visitor who types a query into your search box is telling you exactly what they want. That intent signal is the most valuable data point in commerce — more valuable than the page they landed on, the campaign that brought them, or the time they spent browsing.

Most commerce platforms in 2008 treated search as an afterthought: a database LIKE query over product names and descriptions. We built Hanzo Search as a separate, first-class component.

## Design Decisions

**Intent modeling.** A search for "waterproof jacket" and a search for "rain jacket" should return the same results. Lexical matching fails both users. Hanzo Search included synonymy and semantic expansion from the start — before transformer-based embeddings existed, we used co-occurrence matrices built from purchase data to expand query intent.

**Merchandising rules.** Organic search relevance and business priorities are different things. A sold-out product should rank lower. A high-margin product deserves a lift. New arrivals need exposure. Hanzo Search separated relevance scoring from merchandising rules, letting both run simultaneously.

**Faceted navigation.** Filtering by attribute (size, color, price range, category) is a search interaction, not a separate browsing mode. Facets were built into the query engine, not bolted on as a UI layer.

**Analytics integration.** Every search query, every result click, every zero-result query was fed back into the Hanzo Datastore. Zero-result queries drove vocabulary expansion. Click data drove relevance tuning. The search engine improved automatically from usage.

## Why This Mattered for AI

The search query log became one of our most valuable training datasets years later. What people searched for — and what they bought or didn't buy after searching — is a clean signal for preference learning that no synthetic dataset replicates.

Everything we built in personalization and recommendation was enriched by a decade of real commerce search behavior.
