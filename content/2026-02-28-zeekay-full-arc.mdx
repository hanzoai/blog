# 700+ Repos and Counting: Building the Open AI Stack

547 repos on my personal GitHub. Another 700+ across the organizations I run: github.com/hanzoai, github.com/luxfi, github.com/zenlm, github.com/zoo-labs, github.com/hanzo-js. The bio says "Open Sourceror." That's accurate.

This is what it looks like when you believe open protocols win — and you build accordingly.

## Open Protocols Win. Always.

TCP/IP beat every proprietary network protocol. HTTP beat every closed web standard. Linux beat every proprietary Unix. Git beat every source control system that charged per seat. The pattern is consistent enough to treat as an axiom.

Infrastructure that becomes foundational becomes open. The open version wins by giving everyone a reason to improve it, and no one a reason to route around it.

I started Hanzo Commerce in 2008 with that axiom in mind. The commerce layer — checkout, payments, cart state, behavioral analytics — should be API-first, developer-native, and composable. Not locked to a SaaS vendor. Not opaque. Hanzo.js shipped to npm when npm was barely a browser thing; we were betting the module ecosystem would go universal. It did.

Fifteen open repositories in the hanzo-js org. Every commerce primitive you need. MIT licensed.

## AI Research Since Before It Had a Name

The Hanzo AI stack started as recommendation systems in 2012. By 2013 we were running K-means clustering on ad combinations — finding high-performing creative permutations algorithmically instead of guessing. By 2015 we had LSTM-based generative models producing marketing copy trained on thousands of A/B-tested campaigns with attached conversion data.

"Generative AI" wasn't a term yet. We were just using the best sequence modeling tools available to solve real commercial problems. The transformer architecture arrived in 2017 and we moved to it immediately.

The research compounds: better models from more data, more data from better models attracting more clients, more clients generating more training signal. The 303 repositories in the hanzoai org represent that compounding made tangible — model infrastructure, agent frameworks, cloud APIs, MCP tooling, evaluation pipelines. All open.

## The Zen Model Family: Frontier for Everyone

The Zen models are the most direct expression of the open-AI thesis.

zen-nano: 600M parameters, Apache 2.0, runs on a Raspberry Pi.
zen4-ultra: 1.04T parameters, MIT licensed, same benchmarks as frontier closed models.

Everything in between — zen-eco, zen-coder, zen-max, zen-vl, the full zen4 family — available for download, modification, and deployment without a subscription, without an API key, without asking anyone's permission.

The 83 repositories in the zenlm org are the infrastructure around those models: training code, evaluation benchmarks, GGUF quantizations for llama.cpp, MLX builds for Apple Silicon, inference servers. Open stack, top to bottom.

When frontier AI is open-weight, anyone can run it. Healthcare researchers. Independent developers. Countries without access to US cloud infrastructure. Students. Scientists. The value of open-weight models isn't that they're free — it's that they're *permissionless*.

## Lux: Settlement Infrastructure Nobody Controls

The AI economy needs financial infrastructure that operates at the speed of software — programmable, trustless, borderless. Lux is that layer.

289 repositories: the node software, consensus implementation, SDK, CLI, netrunner testing framework, genesis configuration tools, wallet. Post-quantum cryptography built in from the start — lattice-based signatures because ECDSA will be broken by quantum computers and the transition needs to happen before that day, not after.

Lux handles the settlement for Hanzo Cloud compute markets, Zoo Labs research grants, and the transactions that agents make on behalf of their users. Nobody owns it. Anybody can run a validator. The 289 repos are the proof of work.

## Zoo Labs: Research as Public Goods

The 25 repositories in the zoo-labs org represent something different: research that commercial incentives systematically underfund.

Interpretability — understanding what's actually happening inside large models. Decentralized training — distributing model training so no single entity controls the compute. ZIPs governance (zoo.ngo/zips) — structured community decision-making for AI research direction.

Zoo Labs Foundation is a 501(c)(3) because the research needs to be owned by nobody. The findings go to everyone. The governance prevents capture by any commercial interest, including Hanzo's.

## The Open Stack, 2026

```
Zen (Models)       → open-weight, 600M to 1T+, Apache/MIT
Hanzo (Cloud)      → open protocols, 303 repos, developer APIs
Zoo Labs (R&D)     → open research, DeSci, decentralized training
Lux (Settlement)   → open L1, post-quantum, permissionless
```

Each layer is useful independently. Together they're the open alternative to the closed AI stack that everyone else is building.

## What's Coming That's Actually Exciting

**Private inference**: Running AI models on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. The math is solved (multi-party computation, partially homomorphic encryption). The engineering efficiency gap is closing. When it does, you can run frontier AI on sensitive data — medical records, financial data, private research — without trusting any cloud provider.

**Verifiable inference**: Zero-knowledge proofs that a specific model produced a specific output. Audit trails for AI with the same cryptographic properties as signed transactions. Critical for regulated industries and scientific reproducibility.

**On-chain compute markets**: Provably decentralized training and inference, where compute providers and model consumers transact without intermediaries. Settled on Lux. The GPU as a utility, not a subscription.

**Quantum-resistant cryptography at scale**: Lattice signatures replacing ECDSA across the entire web before quantum computers make it urgent rather than prudent.

These aren't speculative research topics. They're engineering problems with known solution shapes and active development. Building them in the open because that's how infrastructure actually gets built.

The next 700 repos are going to be more interesting than the first 700.
