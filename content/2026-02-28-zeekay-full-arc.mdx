# The Open Stack: 700 Repositories, One Thesis

Computation should not be owned by any single entity.

That's the thesis. Every repository, protocol, and model that's come out of this work is an implementation of that principle in code.

## The Structure

Four organizations, one coherent stack:

**Hanzo** (github.com/hanzoai — 303 repos): Commerce infrastructure, AI cloud, developer tooling, MPC cryptography, agent frameworks. The operational layer. Open protocols where it matters, proprietary where justified by costs.

**Lux** (github.com/luxfi — 289 repos): L1 settlement infrastructure. Nobody owns it. Post-quantum cryptography from the start — lattice-based signatures, not ECDSA. The financial layer for systems that can't afford a single point of control.

**Zoo Labs** (github.com/zoo-labs — 25 repos): Research that commercial incentives won't fund. Interpretability. Decentralized training. ZIPs governance. 501(c)(3) — structurally unowned, findings public.

**ZenLM** (github.com/zenlm — 83 repos): Open-weight models, 600M to 1T+ parameters, Apache 2.0 / MIT. The model family that doesn't require asking permission to run.

## The Commerce Origins (2008)

Hanzo started as commerce infrastructure because that was the gap. Merchants needed checkout, payments, behavioral analytics, and A/B testing infrastructure that was composable and developer-native — not locked to a SaaS vendor.

The real value was always the data layer. Behavioral event logs. Purchase histories. A/B test outcomes. The aggregate signal from thousands of merchants training models that no individual merchant could train alone.

By 2012 we had recommendation systems. By 2013 we were doing K-means clustering on ad creative combinations to find high-performers algorithmically. By 2015 we had LSTM-based generative models producing copy trained on A/B-tested campaigns. The generative AI infrastructure predates the term by years.

## The Cryptographic Layer

MPC (multi-party computation) and ZK proofs are not product features. They're the correct architecture for systems that need to be trustworthy without being trusted.

Hanzo MPC implements CGGMP21 and FROST — threshold signature schemes where private keys are never reconstructed in one place. Hanzo Vault is custody infrastructure for tokenized assets. Lux implements CRYSTALS-Dilithium for post-quantum signatures.

ECDSA will be broken by quantum computers. The timeline is uncertain; the mathematical certainty is not. Building with post-quantum cryptography now costs very little. Migrating later, under pressure, costs enormously.

## Open-Weight AI

The Zen model family exists because a language model that only runs on someone else's server is a language model someone else controls.

zen-nano at 600M parameters runs on consumer hardware. zen4-ultra at 1T+ parameters matches frontier benchmarks. Apache 2.0, MIT licensed, downloadable, locally deployable, no API key required.

The 83 repositories in the zenlm org are the infrastructure: training code, evaluation benchmarks, quantizations, inference servers. The full stack is open.

## What's Left

The unsolved engineering problems at the intersections:

**Private inference** — MPC applied to LLM inference. Running frontier models on data you never decrypt. The math is there; the efficiency isn't. Yet.

**Verifiable compute** — ZK proofs of model execution. Prove a specific model produced a specific output without re-running the model. Audit trails with cryptographic guarantees.

**Decentralized training** — gradient synchronization across untrusted nodes, with incentive mechanisms on Lux for compute markets.

**Post-quantum migration** — systematic transition of the existing internet's cryptographic infrastructure before quantum computers make it urgent rather than prudent.

These are solvable. The solutions will be open.
