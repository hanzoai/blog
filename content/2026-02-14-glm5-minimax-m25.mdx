# Now Available: GLM-5 (744B) and MiniMax M2.5 (230B)

Two massive open-source model releases landed this week, and both are live on the Hanzo AI Gateway.

## GLM-5 — 744B Parameters, Open Source

Released February 11 by Zhipu AI, GLM-5 is a 744B-parameter reasoning model that currently leads open-source benchmarks. It's the largest open-weight model available and delivers strong performance across reasoning, math, and code tasks with a 203K context window.

Available now through the gateway:

```bash
curl https://llm.hanzo.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HANZO_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model": "z-ai/glm-5", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Solve this..."}]}'
```

## MiniMax M2.5 — 230B Parameters, Multimodal, Open Source

Released February 12, MiniMax M2.5 is a 230B-parameter multimodal model that handles both text and vision inputs. It's one of the few open-source models at this scale with native multimodal capabilities.

```bash
curl https://llm.hanzo.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HANZO_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model": "minimax/minimax-m2.5", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Describe this image..."}]}'
```

## Why This Matters

The open-source frontier keeps advancing. GLM-5's 744B parameters and MiniMax M2.5's multimodal capabilities mean developers now have open-weight alternatives that compete with the best proprietary models — available at competitive pricing through a single API.

Both models join the 100+ models available through the Hanzo AI Gateway with zero markup on third-party pricing. Use the same API key for everything: our Zen models, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and now these.
