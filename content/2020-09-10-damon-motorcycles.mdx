# Damon Motorcycles: 500x ROI on Electric Motorcycle Marketing

Motorcycle riders are skeptical people. They're skeptical of anything that promises to change what riding feels like — and for good reason. Motorcycling is tactile, visceral, and deeply personal. The last thing a rider wants is a product designed by people who don't understand why they ride.

Damon Motorcycles had built something genuinely extraordinary: the HyperSport, an electric motorcycle with a 200+ mile range, 200 mph top speed, and a proprietary safety system called CoPilot that used cameras and radar to warn riders of blind-spot hazards in real time.

It was a better motorcycle by nearly every objective measure. But selling it meant convincing riders who had never considered electric to reconsider everything.

## The Brief

Damon came to us needing a campaign that would generate qualified leads — riders who were genuinely interested in buying, not just curious about the technology. The electric vehicle space was full of aspirational marketing that drove engagement but not sales.

They needed conversion, not impressions.

## The Strategy: Safety, Not Speed

The instinct for a 200 mph electric motorcycle campaign is to lead with performance. We didn't.

We led with CoPilot.

Motorcycle fatalities are a real and painful problem. The majority of fatal motorcycle accidents involve another vehicle. CoPilot's 360° awareness system — warning riders of hazards behind and to the sides before they became threats — wasn't just a feature. It was a reason to reconsider every assumption about what a motorcycle could be.

The campaign built around a simple emotional truth: this motorcycle wants you to come home. The performance was a proof point for the engineering quality. The range was a proof point for the practicality. But the core message was about the rider's life, not the bike's specifications.

## Targeting

We built audience segments around three types of riders: performance riders who cared about specs, commuter riders who cared about cost and practicality, and safety-conscious riders who were already thinking about risk. CoPilot was the bridge across all three — it spoke to different concerns in the same physical product.

Retargeting sequences were built around each segment's specific objections: range anxiety for commuters, charging infrastructure for long-distance riders, handling and feel for performance riders.

## Results

- **500x return on marketing investment**
- **230% increase in qualified leads**
- **65% conversion rate** from qualified lead to deposit
- **45% reduction in customer acquisition cost**
- Featured in Wired, The Verge, Forbes, and major automotive publications

The campaign established Damon as a serious player in the EV space at a time when electric motorcycles were still widely seen as a niche curiosity.
