# Introducing the Hanzo Platform

Three years ago, we launched Crowdstart to help crowdfunding creators build sustainable businesses. Today, we are taking the next step: Crowdstart becomes Hanzo, a complete commerce platform for the modern era.

## Why the Change

Crowdstart solved a specific problem well. But our customers' needs expanded:

- Creators became brands with full product lines
- One-time campaigns became subscription businesses
- US-focused operations went global
- Simple storefronts required enterprise features

We could patch Crowdstart indefinitely, or we could build the platform our customers actually need. We chose to build.

## What is Hanzo

Hanzo is a commerce platform built on three pillars:

### Commerce Engine

The transaction core that powers everything:

- Multi-currency, multi-language by default
- Subscription and one-time in the same cart
- Complex pricing rules and promotions
- Tax compliance for 190+ countries

### Intelligence Layer

AI and analytics integrated throughout:

- Real-time dashboards and alerting
- Automated recommendations
- Predictive inventory management
- Marketing optimization (Earle)

### Developer Platform

APIs and tools for custom experiences:

- RESTful and GraphQL APIs
- Webhooks for event-driven integrations
- SDKs for web, mobile, and server
- Headless commerce capabilities

## Migration Path

Existing Crowdstart customers migrate seamlessly:

- All data transfers automatically
- URLs redirect properly
- Existing integrations continue working
- New features unlock immediately

No action required. Your Crowdstart account is now a Hanzo account.

## Pricing

Hanzo maintains Crowdstart's straightforward pricing:

- **Starter**: Free for small volumes
- **Growth**: Percentage of revenue, all features
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing, dedicated support

No seat licenses. No feature tiers. No surprises.

## The Name

Hanzo references the legendary ninja Hattori Hanzo, known for precision and effectiveness. Our platform should work silently in the background, handling complexity so you can focus on your business.

## What's Next

This is a foundation, not a finish line. Coming soon:

- Mobile SDKs (iOS and Android)
- Expanded payment methods
- Advanced fraud detection
- Deeper analytics

Thank you to every Crowdstart customer who helped us get here. The next chapter begins now.
