# TrillerFest: 5 Million Viewers, $2M for COVID Relief

In March 2020, every concert on earth was canceled.

Arenas went dark. Tour buses sat in parking lots. Artists who had spent years building live performance careers watched their entire calendar disappear in two weeks.

Triller called us in April. They wanted to do something that had never been done before: a genuine music festival, with major artists, broadcast live, that people could attend from their living rooms. And they wanted it to matter — both for the artists and for COVID relief.

The brief was three days. A hundred artists. The biggest virtual music event in history.

## The Scale Problem

Virtual concerts existed before TrillerFest. Artists had done Instagram Lives, YouTube performances, Zoom sets. But those were one-off moments. A music festival has a different requirement: it has to feel like an event, not a stream. The accumulation of artists and energy over days, the sense that something is happening that you're part of — that's what makes a festival a festival.

Producing that virtually required solving problems that didn't have prior solutions:

**Scheduling and coordination.** A hundred artists across three days meant a hundred production relationships, a hundred technical setups, a hundred moments that could fail. We built the production runbook that coordinated logistics, technical requirements, and timing across every performance.

**Distribution.** TrillerFest was cross-platform by design — Triller's app, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter. Not a simulcast, but a coordinated multi-platform release where each platform's audience got an experience native to where they were watching. Social content was produced and released in real time throughout the event.

**Revenue and relief.** The charitable component required its own infrastructure — donation mechanisms, real-time totals, artist co-promotion of the relief fund.

## The Artists

The lineup included artists across hip-hop, pop, R&B, and country — acts that ordinarily wouldn't share a festival bill. The virtual format removed the geographic constraints that normally force festival curators to choose. An artist in LA and an artist in Nashville could both perform on the same day without either getting on a plane.

## Results

- **5 million viewers** across platforms over three days
- **100+ artists** performed live
- **$2 million raised** for COVID-19 relief efforts
- **3.2 million social impressions** generated during the event
- **350% increase** in Triller app downloads during the festival window

TrillerFest became the benchmark for virtual music events. In the 18 months that followed, dozens of brands, platforms, and artists used it as the model for what a live virtual event could be.
