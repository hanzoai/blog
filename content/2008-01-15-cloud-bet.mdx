# We're Building on Google App Engine. Here's Why.

Google shipped App Engine a few weeks ago. Most developers are ignoring it — the datastore is unfamiliar, the sandbox has real constraints, the documentation is thin. We're deploying our entire platform on it.

Here's why.

## The Core Problem We're Solving

Commerce applications fail in a specific way: they work fine in normal operation, then fall over on their best day. A product launch, a press mention, a campaign that lands — the traffic spike arrives and the server can't handle it. The store goes down exactly when it most needs to be up.

Traditional infrastructure solutions require predicting traffic and provisioning capacity in advance. You over-provision (expensive) or under-provision (dangerous). There's no good answer.

App Engine's auto-scaling eliminates the problem. Deploy code, Google handles the capacity. Ten requests or ten thousand — the infrastructure responds without manual intervention.

## The Architecture We're Building

The Hanzo Commerce data layer is designed around App Engine's distributed datastore from day one. We're not retrofitting a relational database schema — we're building the data model to be horizontally scalable from the start.

That means:

- **Event-sourced order state**: orders as immutable event logs, not mutable records. Safe to replicate, safe to replay.
- **Denormalized analytics**: query patterns for commerce (conversion funnels, revenue attribution, session analysis) built into the data model, not computed at query time.
- **Eventual consistency where safe, strong consistency where required**: cart state can be eventually consistent; payment state cannot. We're designing the boundary explicitly.

This is harder to build than a standard CRUD app on a relational database. It produces infrastructure that doesn't fail under load.

## The Constraints Are Acceptable

App Engine has real limitations: no raw socket access, 30-second request deadline, restricted background processing. We've evaluated each one. None of them block what we need to build.

The restrictions that remain are ones we can design around today and that we expect Google to relax as the platform matures. The scale guarantees are not something we can build ourselves at this stage.

## The Bet

We're three weeks into building. The datastore design is working. The first API endpoints are live. The commerce primitives — product catalog, cart state, order management — are taking shape on infrastructure that will scale to whatever we need it to scale to.

The bet is simple: managed cloud infrastructure is where serious web applications are going. Being early means building there before the ecosystem catches up, and contributing to that ecosystem in the process.

We'll have more to share as we build out.
