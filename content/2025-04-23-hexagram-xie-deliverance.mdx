# ䷧ Xiě — Deliverance: When the Fix Ships

Thunder over water. The storm breaks the stagnation. Rain falls. The earth receives it. This is the moment of release — not just relief, but productive release. Xiě follows Jiǎn directly in the sequence of hexagrams. After obstruction comes deliverance. The energy of the two forms a unit: obstruction is temporary; release is the natural state that follows.

In engineering, Xiě is release day. It is the deploy after the hotfix is ready. It is the merge of the PR that has been blocking the team. It is the infrastructure change that resolves a week-old incident. The fix is done — the only remaining question is execution.

## Dispatch Quickly, Correct Minimally

The I-Ching's guidance for Xiě is unusually concrete: when deliverance arrives, act quickly and do not linger on past troubles. Return to normalcy without ceremony.

Applied to shipping: when a hotfix is ready, ship it. Do not wait for the perfect moment. Do not batch it with other changes. Do not review it for the third time looking for additional problems. The longer a fix sits undeployed, the longer the system is in a degraded state.

The exception: if the fix requires a coordinated deployment — multiple services, schema migrations, cache invalidations — then the ceremony is not optional. But even then, the preparation should happen in parallel and the deployment should be executed with speed once the window opens.

Hanzo's incident response process codifies this. When a fix is marked ready, the deployment does not wait for the next scheduled release window unless the fix itself has a scheduling dependency. The pipeline runs. The fix ships.

## What Release Day Actually Requires

Release day is not when you write the code. Release day is a system that requires its own inputs:

- A working deployment pipeline that has been tested before the incident
- Runbooks for the failure modes associated with this type of change
- Monitoring and alerting that will confirm the fix is working within the first few minutes post-deploy
- A rollback plan that has been validated, not assumed
- Clear communication about what is being deployed and to whom

Teams that lack these inputs cannot have a clean Xiě. They can ship the code, but the release does not achieve deliverance — it trades one kind of uncertainty for another. The storm breaks, but the ground is not ready to receive the rain.

## The Hotfix That Isn't

A common trap: shipping something that looks like a fix but is actually a temporary suppression. The error rate drops. Monitoring returns to green. The incident is closed. Two weeks later the same failure mode recurs, with additional complexity from the suppression layer.

Xiě requires that the release actually resolves the underlying condition. A fix that treats symptoms without addressing causes is not deliverance — it is deferral. The obstruction did not resolve; it went underground.

The distinction is visible in root cause analysis. "Fixed by increasing timeout" is deferral if the underlying cause of the timeout is not addressed. "Fixed by resolving the database query bottleneck that caused timeouts" is resolution.

## After the Release

Xiě's guidance about not dwelling on past troubles has a practical application: once the fix is shipped and confirmed, do the postmortem cleanly and move on. Document the failure mode, the fix, the detection gap. Close the incident. Return to normal cadence.

The teams that stay in incident mode long after the incident is resolved create secondary damage: morale, focus, trust. The storm broke. The rain fell. Return to work.

Thunder followed by rain. The release follows the build. Ship it.
