# ䷩ Yì — Increase: How Small Improvements Compound

Wind over thunder. Both forces move outward, in the same direction. Increase comes from the alignment of movement, not from single massive efforts. The I-Ching describes Yì as the moment when conditions are right for growth — but the growth is sustained by consistent right action, not by one decisive move.

This is the engineering principle that is hardest to hold onto under deadline pressure: small, consistent improvements compound. The 1% better system is not 1% ahead after a year. After 365 daily 1% improvements, it is 37 times better. This arithmetic is not contested. Acting on it consistently is.

## The Compounding Stack

Software systems have multiple dimensions along which improvement compounds:

**Test coverage**: Every test added makes the next test slightly easier to write (patterns are established, test infrastructure exists). Every test caught makes future regressions cheaper to fix. A codebase at 80% test coverage is significantly more than twice as valuable as a codebase at 40%.

**Documentation**: Every accurate doc reduces onboarding time. Every onboarded engineer writes better docs because they understand what would have helped them. The quality of documentation compounds faster than the size of the team.

**Performance**: A 10ms reduction in p99 latency reduces timeout rates, which reduces retry load, which reduces total infrastructure cost by more than the initial savings suggest. Latency improvements compound through the system.

**Model quality**: This is the explicit design of iterative model training. Each generation of ZenLM models is trained starting from the previous generation's outputs as part of the dataset. The improvement is not just from better architectures — it is from the compound effect of training on progressively better synthetic data generated by progressively better models.

## Open Source as Compound Interest

Open source is a compound interest machine. Code written once and published accumulates value that the original author did not create. Other engineers use it, find edge cases, file issues, submit patches. The codebase improves through contributions the original author could not have written alone.

The Zoo Labs research infrastructure is open by default precisely because of this. Research code that is published accumulates citations, forks, improvements, and scrutiny. Research code that is kept private accumulates only the work of the people who hold it. The compound rate for open code is dramatically higher.

The same logic applies to open-weight models. ZenLM publishes model weights. The community runs the models, finds capabilities the release notes missed, fine-tunes for specialized applications, quantizes for hardware the original team didn't have access to. Every model release is an investment that pays returns the team cannot directly control.

## The Enemy of Compounding

Compounding requires continuity. Discontinuities — rewrites, migrations, major version breaks, team turnover — reset the compound curve to zero in their affected areas. This is not an argument against ever rewriting, migrating, or versioning. It is an argument for treating these events as expensive, not as routine.

Every "let's just rewrite this" resets the accumulated understanding embedded in the existing code. That understanding is valuable even when the code is messy. The rewrite usually recapitulates the same mistakes because the lessons are lost along with the code.

Write in a way that compounds. Make the next improvement easier than the last. Publish what you build. The curve bends upward with time if you do not break it.

Wind and thunder. Consistent force, aligned direction. The increase is arithmetic.
