# ䷛ Dà Guò — Great Exceeding: Systems Under Extraordinary Load

Lake above, wind below. The great beam bends — the middle is excessive, the ends are weak. The twenty-eighth hexagram describes the condition of a structure under load that exceeds its design envelope: it does not immediately break, but it bends. The question is whether it bends back or continues to deform.

In production systems, great exceeding is traffic spikes, resource exhaustion under unexpected load, model inference queues that grow faster than they drain, database connections that saturate during peak. Every system has a maximum operating envelope. The question is whether you know where it is before it breaks in production.

## What Stress Testing Reveals

Stress testing a system is not the same as load testing. Load testing answers: can the system handle the expected load? Stress testing answers: what happens when the system exceeds its expected load, and how does it fail?

The failure mode under stress is often not the bottleneck you expected. You stress-tested the API layer. The API layer scales fine. What breaks is the database connection pool at 10x traffic — a bottleneck that was invisible at normal load because the pool was never fully utilized.

This is the specific value of stress testing: it reveals bottlenecks that are invisible during normal operation. A system that has only been tested at normal load has a set of unknown failure modes that will be discovered in production, at the worst possible time.

Dà Guò: the beam bends where the material is weakest. Run the stress test to find where your material is weakest before production load finds it for you.

## Chaos Engineering

Chaos engineering extends stress testing from load-induced failures to failure-induced failures. Rather than asking "what happens when load increases," it asks "what happens when specific components fail?"

The canonical implementation: randomly terminate instances in production during business hours. This forces the system to demonstrate resilience in practice, not just in design. If the system is designed to tolerate instance failure but has never actually had an instance fail in production, there may be failure modes that the design missed.

Netflix's Chaos Monkey was the first widely deployed version of this. The principle has generalized: chaos engineering now covers network partitions, clock skew, resource exhaustion, dependency latency injection, and more.

For the Hanzo inference infrastructure, chaos engineering runs as part of the staging environment: nodes are randomly terminated, network latency is injected between services, model shards are made to return errors at a configured rate. The application layer is expected to handle all of these gracefully. If it doesn't, the failure is surfaced in staging rather than production.

## Design Patterns for Overload

Several patterns are designed specifically for graceful behavior under great exceeding:

**Load shedding**: When load exceeds capacity, the system actively rejects requests rather than queueing them indefinitely. A rejected request fails fast with a clear error. A queued request waits for an unpredictable duration and then fails with a timeout — worse for the caller, worse for the system. Explicit load shedding is the correct failure mode.

**Autoscaling with headroom**: Autoscaling that responds to high utilization only when it is already high provides insufficient protection against traffic spikes. Autoscaling that maintains a headroom target (e.g., average utilization below 60%) scales preemptively, before saturation is reached.

**Resource pooling with explicit limits**: Every resource pool (database connections, worker threads, inference slots) has an explicit maximum size. When the pool is exhausted, new requests are rejected fast rather than queued. The pool size is set based on measured capacity, not hope.

**Graceful degradation**: When a component fails under load, the system continues to serve what it can. A recommendation service that is overloaded returns default recommendations rather than blocking the checkout flow waiting for personalized ones.

## The Bent Beam

The hexagram's image is important: the beam bends but has not yet broken. Great exceeding is not necessarily catastrophic — it is a warning sign that the design is being tested beyond its envelope.

A well-instrumented system shows this bending: latency percentiles rising, error rates climbing, queue depths growing. These are the signals that the system is approaching or exceeding its operating envelope. The engineering response is not panic — it is the pre-designed response: scale up, shed load, engage the fallback.

The beam that breaks is the beam that was never tested at load. Know where your material is weakest. Design the failure mode before it arrives uninvited.
