# Now Available: ByteDance Seed 2.0 and Qwen3-Coder-Next

Two models that shipped in the past two weeks are live on the Hanzo AI Gateway.

## Seed 2.0 Pro — ByteDance's Frontier Reasoning Model

Released February 14 by ByteDance's Seed Team, Seed 2.0 Pro is a fully multimodal reasoning model (text, image, video input) that competes directly with GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro on benchmarks. It ranks top-6 on LMSYS Chatbot Arena and top-4 on Vision Arena.

Key specs:
- **Full multimodal** — text, image, and video input
- **State-of-the-art** on MathVision and MotionBench
- **Strong agentic tool-calling** — built for agent workflows

```bash
curl https://llm.hanzo.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HANZO_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model": "bytedance-seed/seed-2.0-mini", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}]}'
```

Also available: **Seed 2.0 Mini** for high-throughput batch processing.

## Qwen3-Coder-Next — Open-Source Coding Agent

Released February 3, Qwen3-Coder-Next is an 80B-parameter MoE model with only 3B active parameters, purpose-built for coding agents. It achieves 70.6% on SWE-bench Verified while running on a single consumer workstation with 46 GB RAM.

Key specs:
- **80B total / 3B active** — ultra-sparse MoE
- **256K context window**
- **Apache 2.0** — fully open for commercial use
- **70.6% SWE-bench Verified** — frontier-class code generation
- **10x throughput** vs dense models of equivalent quality

```bash
curl https://llm.hanzo.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HANZO_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model": "qwen/qwen3-coder-next", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}]}'
```

## The Gateway Advantage

Every model — from ByteDance's proprietary Seed 2.0 to Alibaba's open-source Qwen3-Coder-Next — is accessible through the same API key. No new accounts, no new SDKs. Just change the model name.
