# Commerce Templates: Launch in Days, Not Months

The most common failure mode for early-stage products is not building the wrong thing — it is spending too long building anything at all. A crowdfunding campaign that takes four months to launch has missed the cultural moment. A pre-sale that needs custom development has already lost to the competitor who shipped last month.

In 2012 we built the Hanzo template system to solve this problem.

## The Design Philosophy

A template is not a theme. A theme makes your store look different. A template makes your store work for a specific use case.

We built templates for the actual commerce patterns we saw repeatedly: crowdfunding pre-sales, limited-run product drops, subscription launches, digital product sales, waitlists with payments. Each template had the UX optimized for that specific flow — checkout sequences, social proof placement, scarcity signals — without requiring any configuration from the merchant.

You choose the template. You fill in the product details. You launch.

## Technical Architecture

Templates were built as composable components on the Hanzo.js SDK. Each template was a collection of components wired to the Commerce API: a product component, a cart component, a checkout component, a confirmation component.

The design system was opinionated but overrideable. Brands with strong design direction could replace any component while keeping the commerce logic. Brands that just needed to launch used the defaults.

This architecture — composable components with sensible defaults and override capability — became the pattern we applied to every UI system we built after. Including the Hanzo UI component library used across all Hanzo products today.

## Launch Velocity

The result was what we intended: products that would have taken three months to build now launched in under a week. Merchants validated their ideas with real customers and real revenue before investing in custom development.

For crowdfunding specifically, this mattered enormously. Campaign momentum is time-sensitive. A campaign that launches in January competes for attention differently than one that launches in April. Speed was a product feature.
