# Unikoin Gold: $34.9M ICO for Blockchain Esports Betting

By 2017, esports betting was a multi-billion dollar industry. Unikrn was already one of its leading platforms — wagering on CS:GO, League of Legends, and Dota 2 matches with real money. But real money meant regulators, and regulators meant restrictions that varied wildly by jurisdiction.

Blockchain offered a path: a token economy that could power wagering across borders, governed by smart contracts rather than payment processors, with the compliance framework built into the economics of the token itself.

Unikrn called it UnikoinGold (UKG).

## The Problem with Cross-Border Betting

Traditional sports betting requires a license for every jurisdiction where a user places a bet. For a global esports audience — where a CS:GO tournament might have viewers and bettors across 40 countries simultaneously — this created an impossible patchwork of requirements.

Unikrn had already built the platform. The question was whether blockchain could solve the regulatory puzzle in a way that was genuinely compliant, not just opaque.

## What We Built

Hanzo worked with the Unikrn team across three areas:

**Blockchain integration.** UKG was an ERC20 token on Ethereum. We helped architect the smart contract system that governed token issuance, escrow, and payout — designed to be auditable and transparent while protecting user funds.

**Regulatory framework.** We worked with Unikrn's legal team to map the 15+ jurisdictions where UKG would operate and build the compliance infrastructure into the token mechanics. This meant geo-restrictions at the contract level for certain jurisdictions, KYC/AML flows integrated into the onboarding, and clear documentation for regulators.

**ICO marketing.** The 2017-2018 ICO boom was chaotic. Legitimate projects competed for attention alongside outright scams. We built the UKG campaign around credibility: the Unikrn brand's existing track record, the technical depth of the team, and transparent disclosures about how funds would be used.

## Results

The UKG ICO raised **$34.9 million** — one of the largest gaming token raises at the time. Platform engagement increased 300%. The token launched across more than 15 jurisdictions.

For esports fans, it meant being able to participate in a wagering economy that was genuinely global. For Unikrn, it meant a treasury to scale the platform and a community of token holders with a stake in the outcome.

## What It Taught Us About Blockchain

The Unikrn engagement confirmed something we'd been thinking about: the real value of blockchain for consumer applications wasn't decentralization for its own sake — it was programmable compliance. Rules that couldn't be bypassed because they were enforced by code.

That insight shaped everything we built in the blockchain space afterward.
