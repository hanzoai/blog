# Bellabeat: Scaling a Women's Health Wearable to $35M

Bellabeat launched in 2014 with a mission that the wearable tech industry had largely ignored: build health tracking devices designed specifically for women. While Fitbit and Apple Watch optimized for general fitness metrics, Bellabeat built around the health patterns and concerns that were specific to women — cycle tracking, stress, sleep, mindfulness.

By the time we engaged with them, Bellabeat had a growing product line, a passionate user base, and the infrastructure of a startup that hadn't yet caught up to its ambitions.

## What We Were Asked to Do

Hanzo served as Bellabeat's outsourced CMO and CTO simultaneously — providing both the marketing strategy and the technical infrastructure to execute it.

This isn't a common engagement model. But for a company at Bellabeat's stage — large enough to have real operations, not large enough to have a full executive team — having a single partner who could ensure the marketing strategy was executable with the available technology (and vice versa) was more efficient than two separate engagements pulling in different directions.

## The Data Infrastructure Problem

Bellabeat's growth had created data silos. User health data lived in the device firmware layer. Marketing data lived in campaign platforms. Customer data lived in the CRM. None of them talked to each other.

We rebuilt the data pipeline — unifying device telemetry, user behavior, and customer records into a single analytics infrastructure. This enabled two things that hadn't been possible before:

**Personalization at scale.** The app could surface insights and nudges based on each user's actual patterns rather than population averages. A user whose sleep consistently degrades before high-stress periods got different recommendations than one whose stress manifested in activity changes.

**Marketing attribution.** For the first time, Bellabeat could connect a marketing touchpoint to a user's downstream health engagement — not just conversion. This let them optimize campaigns for users who would actually benefit from the product, not just users who would buy it and abandon it.

## Marketing Automation

We rebuilt Bellabeat's marketing automation infrastructure around the lifecycle of a health device user: awareness, consideration, purchase, onboarding, habit formation, retention, advocacy.

Each stage got dedicated automation: email sequences calibrated to purchase timing, in-app messaging triggered by engagement milestones, re-engagement campaigns triggered by inactivity patterns.

The effect on retention was significant. Users who completed the full onboarding sequence — now automated — retained at rates 45% higher than those who didn't.

## Results

- **67% increase in user engagement** (sessions per active user)
- **45% improvement in 90-day retention**
- **$35 million revenue run rate** by 2024
- Data infrastructure migrated from siloed systems to unified analytics
