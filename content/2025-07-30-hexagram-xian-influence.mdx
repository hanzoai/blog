# ䷞ Xián — Influence: Systems That Resonate

Lake above mountain. Unlike things in mutual influence — not dominance, but resonance. The thirty-first hexagram is about the influence that arises naturally between systems that are correctly positioned relative to each other. Not compelled, not forced — genuinely arising from the nature of the relationship.

This is the engineering phenomenon of network effects: the property of systems whose value increases with the number of participants, and which therefore create positive feedback loops that reward early adoption and openness.

## Network Effects Are Not Magic

Network effects are often described as if they are a mysterious quality some products have. They are not mysterious. They follow from a specific structural property: the product's value to any individual user increases as more users join.

The telephone network is the classic example: a telephone network with one user has zero value (there's no one to call). With two users, it has some value. With a million users, it has enormous value — not because the individual phones are better, but because the network of connections has grown. Each new user adds value not just to themselves but to every existing user.

Protocols exhibit strong network effects because they are by definition about interoperability: an HTTP server that only one client can speak to is useless. An HTTP server that any HTTP client can speak to is immediately valuable to every HTTP client user in the world.

## The Lux Network Effect

The Lux blockchain's settlement layer is valuable as a settlement layer in direct proportion to how many parties use it for settlement. A settlement layer used by one application is a single-purpose database. A settlement layer used by hundreds of applications — commerce, AI compute, identity, cross-chain bridges — is infrastructure, with the value that infrastructure commands.

This is why open protocols are strategically superior to proprietary ones in network-effect businesses. A proprietary settlement layer that requires permission to join cannot grow as fast as an open one. The network effect is constrained by the permission boundary.

Open protocols — because any party can implement them — grow through adoption, not through sales. The growth curve of adoption-driven protocols can be faster than the growth curve of permission-driven ones, because it removes the human bottleneck of sales cycles.

## Emergent Behavior in Distributed AI

The most interesting network effects in 2025 are emerging from AI model ecosystems. When a base model's weights are open, the number of fine-tuned variants grows with community participation. Each fine-tune that is released back to the community becomes a resource for other community members.

The Zen model family benefits from this: community fine-tunes of Zen-based models exist that Hanzo did not create. The community has taken the open weights and adapted them for specific use cases (specific languages, specific domains, specific deployment hardware) in ways that serve users Hanzo would never have reached directly.

This is Xián — influence that arises from correct positioning, not from force. The open weights create resonance with the community of developers who want to build on them.

## Composable Protocols as Resonance Infrastructure

The other form of influence that Xián describes: the compounding value of composable protocols. When protocols are designed to compose — HTTP and JSON and REST together, or HTTPS and JWT and OAuth together — the combinations create capabilities that neither protocol provides alone.

The Hanzo AI stack is designed for protocol composability: the MCP (Model Context Protocol) composes with any tool that implements the protocol. The Lux settlement layer composes with any application that uses it for settlement. The Zen models compose with any inference infrastructure that speaks their API.

The composability is not accidental. It is the direct result of designing each protocol with a clean interface and no unnecessary dependencies on specific partner protocols.

## The Influence That Isn't Forced

Xián's specific quality: influence without force. The lake rests above the mountain — it doesn't push. The mountain rises below the lake — it doesn't strain. The influence is mutual and natural.

This is the ideal property of an open protocol: it influences behavior (it shapes how participants interact) without compelling (participants choose to implement it because it solves their problem, not because they're required to). The influence is real — once a protocol has enough adoption, it is effectively required for interoperability — but it got there through genuine value, not through gatekeeping.

Build things that resonate. Resonance compounds. Force doesn't.
