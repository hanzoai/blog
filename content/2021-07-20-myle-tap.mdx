# Myle Tap: 200% Crowdfunding Goal for Voice-Activated Wearable

Myle Tap solved a problem that people didn't know they had until they saw the solution: you're driving, hands on the wheel, and you want to call someone, change the music, or open a navigation app. You have to reach for your phone, unlock it, find the app, tap — all while pretending you're not taking your eyes off the road.

Myle Tap was a small wearable device you could stick anywhere — steering wheel, jacket, desk — with one function: you spoke a shortcut, and it happened. Hands-free, no phone touch required.

The hardware concept was clear. The challenge was building an app that made it feel effortless.

## The App Design Problem

Voice interfaces are harder than touch interfaces to design well. With touch, users see what they can tap. With voice, users have to know what they can say — and if they don't know, they either guess or give up.

We built the Myle Tap app around discoverability:

**Progressive disclosure.** New users saw a curated set of the most common shortcuts first. The full command library was accessible but not overwhelming. Users built their shortcut vocabulary naturally as they used the device.

**Shortcut creation.** The key differentiator was that users could create custom voice commands linked to any app action. We built the shortcut creation flow to be as simple as possible: speak the phrase you want to use, select the action it should trigger. That's it.

**Cross-platform integration.** Myle Tap needed to work with iOS and Android, and with the full ecosystem of third-party apps. We built the integration layer to use the platform accessibility APIs — meaning any app that exposed accessibility actions could be controlled through Myle Tap without per-app integrations.

## The Launch Strategy

The crowdfunding campaign launched on Kickstarter with a video that showed the product in real-world use — commuting, in the kitchen, at a desk — not in a staged product demo. The scenarios were chosen based on research into where people actually wanted hands-free access to their apps.

We seeded the campaign with tech media whose audiences would immediately understand the problem being solved: hands-free phone control without Siri or Google Assistant's unpredictability.

## Results

- **200% of crowdfunding goal** achieved
- Featured in TechCrunch, The Gadget Flow, and major tech publications
- App Store and Play Store launch rated as one of the most intuitive voice control apps by early reviewers
- Physical device and app rated seamlessly integrated in user reviews
