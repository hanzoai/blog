# 700+ Open Source Repos: Hanzo's Commitment to Building in the Open

We believe infrastructure should be open. Not as a marketing strategy — as a founding principle.

Today, Hanzo AI's open source footprint spans **700+ repositories** across **6 GitHub organizations**:

- **[hanzoai](https://github.com/hanzoai)** — core platform, APIs, and infrastructure (303 repos)
- **[luxfi](https://github.com/luxfi)** — blockchain, consensus, and DeFi tooling (289 repos)
- **[zenlm](https://github.com/zenlm)** — open-weight language models from 0.6B to 1T+ (83 repos)
- **[hanzo-js](https://github.com/hanzo-js)** — JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs and packages (15 repos)
- **[hanzo-apps](https://github.com/hanzo-apps)** — production applications and deployable templates (8 repos)
- **[zoo-labs](https://github.com/zoo-labs)** — decentralized AI research (Zoo Labs Foundation) (25 repos)

## What's Actually in There

### AI Models (zenlm)
Zen AI models — from zen-nano (0.6B) to zen4-ultra (1.04T) — are fully published on HuggingFace and open-sourced under Apache 2.0 and MIT licenses. Every model card, config, and training artifact is public.

The zen4 family (released Feb 2026) provides unbiased, neutral models at every tier: mini (4B), base (8B), pro (14B), max (30B MoE), coder (80B MoE), and ultra (1.04T MoE) — built for agents, infrastructure, and scientific applications that require consistent, non-filtered reasoning.

### Cloud Infrastructure (hanzoai)
Our cloud platform stack — compute API, routing, storage, KV, pub/sub, search, vector DB, and the entire control plane — is open source. You can run Hanzo infrastructure yourself or contribute to it.

### Blockchain (luxfi)
The Lux Network consensus engine, node implementation, multi-chain VM, and wallet libraries are all open and available for the community to run, fork, and build on.

## Why Open Source First

We've been building open source software since before Techstars '17. The ecosystem we rely on — Linux, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, PyTorch — was built in the open. We owe it to the community to give back.

Open source also makes us better engineers. Public code is reviewed, forked, and stress-tested in ways private code never is.
