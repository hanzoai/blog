---

The Earle paper came from a question that kept recurring across Hanzo merchants: if we have campaign performance data, why are humans still designing the next campaign? The data knows what works. The gap is the optimization loop.

Earle closes that loop with genetic algorithms applied to marketing campaign design.

## Campaigns as Genomes

The central abstraction: a marketing campaign is a genome. Every element — subject line, headline copy, call-to-action text, hero image selection, audience targeting parameters, send time — is a gene. A population of campaigns is a population of genomes.

Standard genetic algorithm machinery follows from there: selection (keep campaigns with higher conversion rates), crossover (combine elements from two successful campaigns), mutation (randomly alter individual elements). The fitness function is conversion rate, measured directly from purchase events.

What makes this non-trivial is that marketing campaigns are not fixed-length binary strings. The genes are heterogeneous: text has structure, images have semantic relationships, audience segments have hierarchical dependencies. Naive crossover across these domains produces nonsense.

## Domain-Specific Genetic Operators

Earle's contribution is genetic operators that respect the structure of each gene type.

**Text operators.** Subject line crossover does not splice character sequences — it splices semantic units: the opener, the value proposition, the call-to-action. Mutations respect sentence structure and brand voice constraints. We built a small grammar that constrained the mutation space to valid marketing copy.

**Image operators.** Image selection is a discrete choice from a catalog. Crossover selects from the top-performing images in each parent. Mutation replaces one image with a randomly sampled alternative weighted by historical performance within the same product category.

**Audience operators.** Targeting segments have hierarchical structure: geographic region contains city, age range contains specific age, interest category contains interest tag. Crossover respects this hierarchy — you cannot combine a parent audience of "New York, 25-34" with a parent audience of "Texas" and produce "New York, Texas." The operator understands what can be meaningfully combined.

## Results

**34% conversion improvement** over human-designed campaigns in controlled experiments. Human marketers designed campaigns using their own judgment and historical intuition. Earle ran from the same data. The comparison is direct.

This is not a small effect. A third more conversions from the same audience is the difference between a campaign that covers its cost and a campaign that drives meaningful revenue.

**2.8x faster convergence than multi-armed bandits.** Multi-armed bandits are the standard alternative: run multiple variants in parallel, dynamically allocate traffic toward the winner. Bandits are effective but they explore the variant space one observation at a time. Genetic algorithms explore the variant space by recombining successful elements — they exploit structure in the search space that bandits treat as opaque.

The 2.8x convergence advantage means Earle finds near-optimal campaigns faster, which matters when campaign windows are short (a product launch, a seasonal promotion, a flash sale).

## What This Required

Large populations need large traffic. Earle was viable at the scale of Hanzo's merchant network — campaigns across 500+ merchants provided enough signal to train the fitness function and run populations with statistical confidence. A single small merchant running Earle in isolation would not have had enough data.

This is an argument for shared infrastructure. Individual merchants benefit from optimization learned across the collective.

## The Name

Earle is named after the geneticist Earle Harold who did foundational work on population genetics. It felt right: the algorithm is population-level optimization applied to a design problem, and the name carries that lineage.

The paper was published in 2016. The system ran in production. The 34% number is from real merchant campaigns, not a synthetic benchmark.
