# ䷀ Qián — Heaven: Pure Creative Force

Six unbroken lines. Pure yang. Maximum potential, zero constraints. The first hexagram of the I-Ching is not about action — it is about the condition *from which* action becomes possible. Heaven does not impose itself. It generates.

This is the state of a system before architecture decisions lock in. Before the first `type Foo interface` is written. Before the schema migration runs. The moment of pure creative potential that engineering teams almost universally squander.

## The Mistake

Most systems begin with too much structure imposed too early. Teams reach for frameworks before they understand the problem. They design schemas before they understand the access patterns. They build microservices before they have a monolith worth splitting.

The creative force of Qián is not about generating more — it is about generating *cleanly*. Six unbroken lines means: no compromise, no muddiness, no coupling introduced before its time. Each component knows its purpose and executes that purpose without contamination from adjacent concerns.

## Orthogonality as Principle

The engineering principle that maps directly here is **orthogonality**: the property that two components have no effect on each other. Change one, the other is unaffected. Rotate one axis, the other doesn't move.

In practice: a cryptographic key derivation function should not know whether it is being called from an HTTP handler or a batch job. A model inference endpoint should not know what routing layer directed traffic to it. A payment processor should not know what commerce platform generated the order.

When you build orthogonal components, you preserve the creative potential of Qián. Each piece can evolve independently. The system can absorb requirements that weren't anticipated during initial design — not because you were clever enough to predict them, but because you were disciplined enough not to entangle things that didn't need to be entangled.

## Applied: Hanzo Component Design

The Hanzo infrastructure stack — routing layer, inference layer, identity layer, settlement layer — is designed with this principle explicitly. The LLM gateway does not care whether the model being served runs locally on Apple Silicon via MLX, remotely on H100s via vLLM, or as a quantized GGUF on edge hardware. The routing layer does not care what model handles the request. The Lux settlement layer does not care what application generated the compute transaction.

Each layer is pure in its domain. The interfaces are thin. The contracts are precise.

This is not elegance for its own sake. It is the engineering expression of Qián: preserving creative potential by not closing off possibilities prematurely.

## The Discipline

Pure creative force requires discipline to protect. Every shortcut that couples two components together is a deduction from the account. Every "just for now" that bleeds domain logic across a boundary costs more than it saves.

The first hexagram is a standard, not a starting condition. You do not arrive at it — you maintain it. You maintain it by asking, before every design decision: does this coupling need to exist? What would need to change if I removed it?

Most of the time, the coupling is unnecessary. Remove it.

Six unbroken lines. Keep them unbroken.
