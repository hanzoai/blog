# Verus Media: The Agency Before the Platform

The company that became Hanzo AI was founded as Verus Media — a digital agency focused on product launches and crowdfunding campaigns. The platform came after.

This sequencing was not accidental. Building software infrastructure without knowing what it needs to do produces infrastructure that solves the wrong problems. We learned what commerce infrastructure needed to do by running campaigns, watching them succeed and fail, and building tools to fix what was broken.

## What Verus Media Did

Crowdstart — the brand under which Verus Media ran its crowdfunding operations — was a full-service launch vehicle: strategy, creative, platform development, and campaign management for hardware and technology products.

The clients were companies trying to validate market demand before investing in production — the model that Kickstarter and Indiegogo made mainstream. They needed creative strategy (what is the story?), technical infrastructure (how do I collect pre-orders?), and marketing execution (how do I reach enough people to prove demand?).

We provided all three. The creative side informed the technical side: when a campaign needed a social proof counter that updated in real time, we built the real-time counter. When a campaign needed A/B testing across landing page variants, we built the testing system. When a campaign needed to handle a surge of traffic from a press hit without crashing, we built the scale layer.

## The Pattern

Every client problem became a platform feature. By 2014 we had built a commerce platform that was deeply informed by real production use cases — not by what we thought commerce platforms should do.

The clients became case studies. SKULLY AR-1's Indiegogo campaign. Damon Motorcycles' pre-launch campaign. The Unikoin Gold token sale. Each one pushed the platform in a direction it needed to go.

## Crowdstart to Hanzo

In 2016, the platform was renamed Hanzo AI. The name reflected what it had become: not just commerce infrastructure, but an AI-driven system for optimizing business outcomes. The genetic algorithm optimizer (Earle), the recommendation engine, the analytics platform — these were AI systems built on top of the commerce infrastructure.

The agency origins shaped everything. We never built abstraction for its own sake. We built for the real problems clients brought us, and generalized from those solutions into platform capabilities.

Techstars '17 confirmed the direction. The thesis was right. We kept building.
