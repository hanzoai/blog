# Now Available: Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex on the Hanzo Gateway

Two major model launches this week, both live on Hanzo within 48 hours of release.

## Claude Opus 4.6

Anthropic's new flagship is available now via the Hanzo AI Gateway. Claude Opus 4.6 brings multimodal capabilities with strong reasoning performance across text and vision tasks.

```bash
curl https://llm.hanzo.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HANZO_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4.6", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'
```

## GPT-5.3 Codex

OpenAI's code-specialized model is also live. GPT-5.3 Codex brings multimodal support and is purpose-built for programming workflows — generation, refactoring, debugging, and code review.

```bash
curl https://llm.hanzo.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HANZO_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model": "openai/gpt-5.3-codex", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Refactor this function..."}]}'
```

## Zero Markup, Same API

Both models are available at provider pricing with zero markup. Use the same API key and endpoint you use for our Zen models or any other model on the platform. No separate accounts, no separate billing.

Over 100 models from every major provider are now available through a single Hanzo API key at [hanzo.ai](https://hanzo.ai).
