# The First Enterprise Client: Learning What Large Scale Actually Means

In 2010, Hanzo Commerce landed its first enterprise client. I won't name them — they were a well-known consumer brand, and the relationship was under NDA — but the technical requirements they brought were unlike anything we'd handled from small merchants.

The volume: tens of thousands of transactions per day with traffic spikes around major marketing events. The reliability requirement: 99.9% uptime with sub-200ms API response times under load. The compliance requirement: PCI DSS Level 1 — the most stringent payment card data security standard.

We had built the infrastructure to be scalable in theory. The enterprise client was the first real test of whether "in theory" and "in practice" were the same thing.

## What We Had to Build

**PCI Level 1 compliance.** Our existing infrastructure was PCI-compliant for smaller volumes. Level 1 required a formal QSA audit, network segmentation documentation, penetration testing, and a security operations process we didn't have formalized. It took four months and a security firm engagement to get there. Everything we learned in that process became standard for how we built infrastructure going forward.

**Dedicated infrastructure.** The enterprise client required tenant isolation — their traffic on their own hardware, with capacity guarantees that multi-tenant infrastructure couldn't provide. We built the Hanzo dedicated infrastructure tier, which would later become Hanzo Enterprise, from this requirement.

**SLA monitoring and reporting.** "99.9% uptime" isn't a number you can report on without instrumenting for it. We built the SLA tracking infrastructure — uptime calculation, P95/P99 latency reporting, error rate dashboards — to have the data to back up the commitments we were making.

**Support escalation paths.** Enterprise clients have operations teams that need to reach a human when something breaks at 2am. We defined our support tiers, escalation procedures, and on-call rotation as a direct result of this client's requirements.

## What We Learned

The lesson wasn't that enterprise was harder. The lesson was that enterprise requirements, taken seriously, forced us to build things that made the entire platform better for everyone.

PCI Level 1 compliance benefited every merchant on the platform — better security, better segmentation, better auditing. SLA monitoring helped us catch and fix issues that had been invisible before we instrumented for them. The dedicated tier gave us a revenue stream that funded infrastructure improvements that scaled down to the shared tier.

Enterprise clients, when they have real standards, are the best product feedback mechanism available.
