# Multi-Modal AI for Commerce

Text-only AI misses most of commerce. Products are visual. Reviews are textual. Behavior is structured data. Today we are launching multi-modal AI capabilities that understand all three.

## The Modality Gap

Traditional commerce AI operates in silos:

- **Text models**: Process descriptions, reviews, search queries
- **Vision models**: Analyze product images
- **Tabular models**: Predict from structured data

Each modality provides partial understanding. Combining them has required manual feature engineering.

## Unified Multi-Modal Models

Our new multi-modal architecture processes all modalities jointly:

```
Input: Product image + Description + Sales data + Reviews
     ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Multi-Modal Encoder             │
│  ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐   │
│  │ Vision  │ │Language │ │Tabular  │   │
│  │Encoder  │ │Encoder  │ │Encoder  │   │
│  └────┬────┘ └────┬────┘ └────┬────┘   │
│       └──────────┼──────────┘          │
│                  ↓                      │
│         Cross-Modal Attention           │
│                  ↓                      │
│         Unified Representation          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
     ↓
Output: Predictions, embeddings, generations
```

The model learns relationships across modalities: which visual features correlate with positive reviews, how descriptions affect conversion, what behavioral patterns indicate purchase intent.

## Applications

### Visual Search

"Find products that look like this":

```python
results = hanzo.search.visual(
    image=uploaded_image,
    filters={"category": "furniture", "price_max": 500}
)
```

Returns products visually similar to the query image, combining visual understanding with structured filtering.

### Product Understanding

Automatic analysis of product listings:

```python
analysis = hanzo.products.analyze(product_id="prod_123")

# Returns:
{
  "visual_attributes": ["modern", "minimalist", "wood"],
  "sentiment_summary": "Customers praise quality, some note assembly difficulty",
  "competitive_position": "premium segment, unique design",
  "optimization_suggestions": [
    "Add lifestyle images showing scale",
    "Mention included tools in description"
  ]
}
```

### Content Generation

Generate descriptions from images:

```python
description = hanzo.content.generate(
    image=product_image,
    style="professional",
    include=["materials", "dimensions", "use_cases"]
)
```

Generate images from descriptions (coming soon):

```python
images = hanzo.content.visualize(
    description="Modern wooden desk, minimalist design",
    style="product_photo",
    variations=4
)
```

### Review Analysis

Understand reviews in context of product:

```python
insights = hanzo.reviews.analyze(
    product_id="prod_123",
    reviews=reviews,
    product_images=images
)

# Identifies: "Reviews mentioning 'smaller than expected' correlate with
# main image lacking size reference. Recommend adding comparison image."
```

## Technical Approach

### Architecture

We use a transformer-based architecture with:

- **Modality-specific encoders**: Pretrained on large datasets
- **Cross-modal attention**: Learns modality relationships
- **Unified decoder**: Generates outputs in any modality

### Training

Models trained on:

- 100M+ product images
- 500M+ product descriptions
- 1B+ customer interactions
- 50M+ reviews

Contrastive learning aligns modalities in shared embedding space.

### Inference

Optimized for production:

- Quantized models for efficiency
- Batch processing for throughput
- Caching for repeated queries

## Privacy

Multi-modal analysis respects privacy:

- Customer data processed in aggregate
- No individual behavior in model weights
- Review analysis anonymizes authors

## API Access

Multi-modal capabilities available through existing APIs:

```bash
POST /v1/products/analyze
POST /v1/search/visual
POST /v1/content/generate
POST /v1/reviews/analyze
```

## What's Next

- Audio modality (voice commerce)
- Video understanding (product demos)
- 3D model generation
- Real-time multi-modal search

Commerce is multi-modal. AI for commerce should be too.
