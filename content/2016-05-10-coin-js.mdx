# Coin.js: Accepting Crypto Before Anyone Asked For It

In 2016, asking customers to pay with Bitcoin was still mostly a stunt. The checkout flow was clunky — copy a wallet address, open a separate app, scan a QR code, wait 10 minutes for confirmation. Nobody optimized for that experience because nobody expected it to matter.

We built Coin.js anyway.

## Why in 2016

The Hanzo thesis on crypto payments was straightforward: the payment friction would decrease over time, the wallet adoption would increase, and when those two curves crossed the merchants who already had crypto checkout would have a significant advantage over those scrambling to integrate.

That thesis looked premature in 2016. It looked prescient in 2017-2018 when crypto payment volume exploded and merchants were paying premium integration fees for what we'd already shipped.

## What Coin.js Was

A JavaScript library for integrating Bitcoin and Ethereum payments into checkout flows. Built on Hanzo Commerce's payment abstraction layer — the same API that translated to Stripe or Braintree, now also translating to crypto payment rails.

Key features:

**QR code generation.** Automatic payment address and amount encoding as a scannable QR code, with the correct amount denominated in the local currency converted to crypto at current exchange rates.

**Payment detection.** WebSocket subscription to the relevant blockchain for incoming transactions, with automatic confirmation counting and merchant notification on sufficient block depth.

**Multi-currency support.** BTC and ETH at launch, with the architecture to add any token-based payment without changes to the merchant's checkout code.

**Exchange rate locking.** At checkout initiation, we locked the exchange rate for 15 minutes — long enough for a customer to complete payment, short enough to limit merchant exposure to crypto volatility.

## The 2017-2018 Vindication

When crypto prices surged in late 2017, there was a brief window where paying in Bitcoin was genuinely interesting to customers — the asset appreciation made people want to use it. Merchants with Coin.js already deployed saw organic crypto checkout adoption without doing anything.

The moment passed. Crypto volatility made it impractical as a primary payment method for most retail contexts. But the infrastructure and the pattern — accepting programmable money natively in checkout — became foundational for everything we built in the Web3 commerce space afterward.
