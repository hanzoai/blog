# Track.js: User Analytics Without the Surveillance Tax

In 2014, user tracking meant Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Kissmetrics. All three approached user identity the same way: identify users by their email address or a persistent cookie, build a profile around that identity, store everything forever.

This created a data liability every company was accumulating — reams of personal information that was useful for analytics but dangerous to hold. The breaches that would make this liability obvious in 2016-2018 hadn't happened yet, but the structural problem was already there.

Track.js approached user identity differently.

## Anonymous-First Design

Track.js generated a random identifier for each user — not tied to any PII — and associated behavior with that identifier. Session data, page views, events, commerce interactions all attached to the anonymous identifier.

Identity resolution happened explicitly: if a user logged in, or provided an email, the anonymous identifier was linked to the identified record in a separate, access-controlled store. But the event log — the high-volume behavioral data — never contained PII.

The architecture had immediate benefits:
- The event log was safe to retain indefinitely (no PII exposure in a breach)
- Cross-device tracking worked without requiring login (probabilistic device fingerprint + deterministic identity resolution on login)
- Deletion requests were simple: delete the identity record, the anonymous event data is already de-identified

## The Behavioral Model

Track.js was designed to answer the question that mattered for commerce: "What sequence of behaviors leads to conversion?" — not "Who is this person?"

The commerce intelligence we needed came from behavioral sequences: visited product page → added to cart → abandoned at shipping → returned three days later → converted. That sequence is analytically rich. The name and email address attached to it add legal liability without analytical value.

## What Happened in 2018

When GDPR came into force in May 2018, companies scrambled to audit their data practices and build consent flows. Companies running Track.js had a structural advantage: their most sensitive behavioral data was already de-identified. The compliance work was a fraction of what surveillance-first analytics required.

This was not foresight — we built what was technically correct in 2014. It turned out that "technically correct" and "legally defensible" were the same architecture.
