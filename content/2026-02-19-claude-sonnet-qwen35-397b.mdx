# Now Available: Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Qwen3.5-397B

Two significant releases from the past week are live on the Hanzo AI Gateway.

## Claude Sonnet 4.6

Anthropic shipped Claude Sonnet 4.6 on February 17 — the workhorse model for teams that need strong reasoning at a lower price point than Opus. It delivers excellent performance across coding, analysis, and creative tasks.

Now available through the standard gateway endpoint:

```bash
curl https://llm.hanzo.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HANZO_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}]}'
```

## Qwen3.5-397B-A17B — Open Source Multimodal MoE

Released February 16 by the Alibaba Qwen team, Qwen3.5-397B-A17B is a 397B-parameter Mixture of Experts model with only 17B active parameters per forward pass. It's natively multimodal, handling text and image inputs, and delivers strong benchmark performance while being remarkably efficient to run.

Key specs:
- **397B total / 17B active** — MoE architecture
- **Multimodal** — text + vision input
- **Open source** — permissive license
- **Strong reasoning** — competitive with proprietary models at the frontier

```bash
curl https://llm.hanzo.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HANZO_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model": "qwen/qwen3.5-397b-a17b", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}]}'
```
