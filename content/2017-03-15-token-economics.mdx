# Token Economics: Commerce in the Age of Programmable Money

In early 2017, the ICO market was accelerating. Bitcoin had passed $1,000 for the first time. Ethereum smart contracts were enabling new token models that hadn't existed two years prior. And we were getting calls from clients who wanted to understand what it meant for their businesses.

We had been thinking about this since 2016, when we shipped Coin.js. But accepting crypto as payment and designing token economies were different problems.

## The Hanzo Commerce + Tokens Framework

We developed a framework for thinking about how tokens could fit into commerce:

**Utility tokens** gave holders access to a service or platform. The token was a pre-purchase of future value — a bet on the platform's success. The mechanics looked like a combination of loyalty points and a Kickstarter backer reward.

**Security tokens** represented an ownership interest — a share of revenue, a governance right, or both. These were closer to traditional securities with different issuance and transfer mechanics.

**Stablecoins** were the rails — a crypto-native unit of account that didn't fluctuate with Bitcoin, making pricing and payment possible without constant conversion overhead.

Most of our client work in 2017 was in utility tokens, specifically for platforms that had strong communities and wanted to create token-based incentive systems. We built:

- Token-gated access mechanics integrated with checkout flows
- Smart contract reward systems that distributed tokens for purchases above threshold
- Vesting and lockup mechanics that aligned token holder incentives with platform growth
- On-chain governance primitives for community decision-making

## The First Token Commerce Integrations

The Unikoin Gold engagement (which launched in early 2018) was the most public example of this work. But before that, we had built token commerce infrastructure for several platforms that wanted community-aligned economics without the regulatory complexity of a public token offering.

The design patterns we established in 2017 — how tokens attach to commerce events, how vesting mechanics work in smart contracts, how on-chain governance interacts with off-chain product decisions — became foundational to everything that followed.

## What 2017 Taught Us

The ICO boom created a lot of noise. Tokens were pitched as solutions to problems that didn't exist, fundraising mechanisms for projects with no real business model, and get-rich-quick vehicles dressed up in technical language.

The signal, buried in the noise: programmable money was real, and the ability to build incentive structures in code — ones that couldn't be changed unilaterally by any party — represented a genuinely new capability for commercial relationships.

We stayed focused on the signal. The noise faded. The capability remained.
