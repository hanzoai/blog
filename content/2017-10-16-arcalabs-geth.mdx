`arcalabs/geth-node` was created on October 16, 2017. It was not a research project. It was a production need.

By mid-2017, enough Hanzo merchants were asking about accepting ETH that the question became operational: how do you run Ethereum infrastructure reliably as part of a commerce platform? The answer was not "use a third-party API." Third-party Ethereum APIs in 2017 were slow, had unpredictable uptime, and added a counterparty dependency to payment flows that had none.

The answer was to run Geth ourselves, with the same operational rigor we applied to our other infrastructure.

## What geth-node Does

`geth-node` is deployment tooling for go-ethereum (Geth) nodes within the Hanzo infrastructure. Specifically:

- Containerized Geth with pinned versions and reproducible builds
- Configuration management for mainnet, testnet, and private networks
- Chain data volume management and snapshot bootstrapping (syncing from scratch takes days; bootstrapping from a snapshot takes hours)
- RPC endpoint configuration with authentication and rate limiting
- Health checking and automatic restart on failure
- Log aggregation compatible with the rest of the Hanzo observability stack

The goal was a Geth node that behaved like any other service in the platform: deployable, observable, and recoverable without manual intervention.

## Ethereum and Commerce

The integration surface between Ethereum and commerce was narrower than the 2017 hype suggested. The real use cases:

**Payment acceptance.** A customer pays in ETH. The commerce platform watches the mempool for transactions to merchant wallet addresses, waits for sufficient confirmation depth, then marks the order as paid. `geth-node` provided the RPC endpoint that order processing called to check transaction status.

**Token-denominated sales.** Some merchants were selling access to their ERC-20 token projects. This required reading ERC-20 `Transfer` events from the Geth node to detect incoming token payments.

**Smart contract crowdsales.** The Arca work (which came later) grew from this: if you are running a token sale via a smart contract, the commerce layer needs to interact with that contract for checkout flows.

## bitcoin-reader Followed

Two months after `geth-node`, on December 9, 2017, `arcalabs/bitcoin-reader` was created. Then `binance-recorder` in January 2018, `ethereum-reader` in February 2018.

The pattern is clear in retrospect: `geth-node` was the first step of building proper multi-chain data infrastructure. You need a node before you need a reader. You need a reader before you need a recorder. You need recorders before you can build analytics on blockchain data.

The `geth-node` project in October 2017 was the founding piece of what became the arcalabs blockchain data stack.

## Why This Mattered for Commerce

Commerce platforms are fundamentally about trust in payment. Every payment method — card, ACH, wire, crypto — has its own verification model. For cards, you trust the card network. For ACH, you trust the bank. For ETH, you trust the consensus of the Ethereum network.

Trusting Ethereum consensus means reading it yourself. An Ethereum node is your direct connection to that consensus. Delegating that connection to a third party means trusting their read of consensus, which adds a layer of trust that undermines the whole model.

Running your own Geth node, with `geth-node` handling the operational complexity, was the correct answer to the question of how to accept ETH in a commerce platform that takes payment trust seriously.

The October 2017 creation date puts this in its real context: right at the peak of Ethereum's first major bull cycle, when the question of accepting crypto in commerce went from hypothetical to urgent.
