# The 2008 Crash and Why We Kept Building

In the fall of 2008, the global financial system came apart. Banks failed. Venture capital froze. Startups that had raised on growth projections built in benign conditions suddenly had no path to the next round.

We were in the middle of building the foundation of what would become the Hanzo Commerce platform. No external funding, no VC timeline, no growth metrics being optimized for investors.

That turned out to be the right position to be in.

## What the Crash Taught Us

The companies that survived 2008 shared a characteristic: they made something people needed, and they could operate it without burning cash to grow. The companies that didn't survive had optimized for growth metrics that were only meaningful in a cheap-money environment.

We read 2008 as confirmation of something we already believed: durable software companies are built on infrastructure that improves over time, serves real needs, and generates value on its own terms. Marketing can accelerate a good product. It cannot create one.

The Hanzo Datastore, KV, and Search components we built in 2008 were not designed for a specific product — they were designed to be correct, fast, and maintainable for years. That meant more time spent on fundamentals and less on features. In 2008, that looked conservative. By 2014 it looked like the right call.

## The Contrarian Reading

While most of the startup ecosystem contracted, the open-source infrastructure world kept moving. Git was improving. NoSQL databases were proliferating. Cloud compute was getting cheaper. The tools for building serious distributed systems were becoming accessible.

We stayed heads-down through 2008 and into 2009 building the data layer that would eventually power recommendation engines, genetic optimization systems, and AI-driven personalization we hadn't yet imagined. The boring infrastructure work was the real product.
