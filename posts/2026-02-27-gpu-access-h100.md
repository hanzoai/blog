# H100 GPUs at $3.48/Hour — 72% Cheaper Than AWS

GPU compute is the bottleneck for every AI team that wants to fine-tune models, run large local inference, or generate images at scale. The bottleneck isn't supply anymore — it's pricing.

AWS charges approximately $12.36 per GPU-hour for H100 access on p5.48xlarge instances. GCP and Azure are in the same range. Lambda Labs offers $2.49–3.29/hr but provides compute only — no integrated model serving, no agent orchestration, no tool ecosystem.

Today Hanzo Bot is opening on-demand H100 access at $3.48/hr, with everything else built in.

## GPU Tiers

| Tier | GPU | VRAM | Price/Hour | Monthly (730 hrs) |
|------|-----|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **GPU Standard** | 1x NVIDIA H100 | 80 GB | **$3.48** | ~$2,540 |
| **GPU Pro** | 2x NVIDIA H100 | 160 GB | **$6.96** | ~$5,081 |
| **GPU Ultra** | 4x NVIDIA H100 | 320 GB | **$13.92** | ~$10,162 |

## Price Comparison

| Provider | 1x H100/hr | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Hanzo Bot** | **$3.48** | + integrated models, tools, storage |
| Lambda Labs | $2.49–3.29 | Compute only |
| CoreWeave | $2.06–4.76 | Compute only, availability varies |
| Together AI | Variable | Serverless, per-token pricing |
| **AWS (p5.48xlarge)** | **~$12.36** | Per-GPU equivalent |
| **GCP (a3-highgpu)** | **~$11.40** | Per-GPU equivalent |

Hanzo is competitive with specialist GPU clouds while offering something they don't: integrated AI model serving, a 100+ model gateway, 260+ MCP tools, and managed compute — all under the same account.

## Use Cases

**Fine-tuning** — Fine-tune Zen models or any open-weight model on your data. LoRA, QLoRA, full fine-tuning. Your model stays on your infrastructure.

**Local inference** — Run large models locally when you need sub-10ms latency for real-time agent loops. No round-trip to an API. No rate limits.

**Image and video generation** — Run Zen3 Image or open-source diffusion models at scale. At $3.48/hr, a single H100 can generate thousands of images per hour.

**ML training** — Multi-GPU configurations (2x and 4x H100) with NVLink for distributed training workloads.

## No Commitment Required

Pay by the hour. Scale to zero when idle. No reserved instances, no annual contracts, no minimum spend.

For teams that need guaranteed capacity, contact sales@hanzo.ai for reserved pricing.

## Getting Started

GPU instances are available now through [hanzo.bot](https://hanzo.bot). Select a GPU tier, deploy in any of our 4 global regions, and start running inference in minutes.
