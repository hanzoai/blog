# Hanzo Network: 10–54% Cheaper Than DigitalOcean, Lightsail, and Vultr

We built the cloud we wanted to use. No surprise egress bills. No paying extra for backups. No different pricing by region. Just compute at a fair price.

Today we're launching [hanzo.network](https://hanzo.network) — a developer cloud with 11 compute tiers across 4 global regions, priced 10–54% below every major indie cloud provider.

## The Price Comparison

### Shared CPU Plans

| Configuration | Hanzo | DigitalOcean | Lightsail | Vultr | Linode |
|--------------|-------|-------------|-----------|-------|--------|
| 1 vCPU / 1 GB | **$5** | $6 | $5 | $6 | $5 |
| 2 vCPU / 2 GB | **$10** | $18 | $10 | $12 | $12 |
| 2 vCPU / 8 GB | **$15** | $24 (4 GB) | $44 | N/A | $36 |
| 4 vCPU / 16 GB | **$39** | $48 (8 GB) | $84 | $48 (8 GB) | $72 |

At the Dev tier ($15/mo), Hanzo gives you **2x the RAM** that DigitalOcean offers at a **38% lower price**. Our 8 GB of RAM at $15 vs their 4 GB at $24 isn't a rounding error — it's a fundamentally different value proposition.

### Dedicated CPU Plans

| Configuration | Hanzo | DigitalOcean | Lightsail | Vultr Optimized | Linode Dedicated |
|--------------|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| 2 ded vCPU / 8 GB | **$25** | $40 (4 GB) | $44 | $60 | $43 (4 GB) |
| 4 ded vCPU / 16 GB | **$49** | $80+ | $84 | $120 | $86 |
| 8 ded vCPU / 32 GB | **$219** | $240 | $164* | $240 | $173 (16 GB) |
| 16 ded vCPU / 64 GB | **$429** | $480 | N/A† | $480 | $346 (32 GB) |
| 32 ded vCPU / 128 GB | **$849** | $960 | N/A† | $960 | N/A |

\* Lightsail Business tier at $164 includes less SSD and transfer than Hanzo's $219 Business plan.
† Lightsail maxes out at 8 vCPU; larger workloads require migration to EC2.

### Enterprise Tiers (No Direct Indie Cloud Equivalent)

| Plan | vCPU | RAM | SSD | Transfer | Price/mo |
|------|------|-----|-----|---------|---------|
| Business | 8 dedicated | 32 GB | 240 GB | 20 TB | **$219** |
| Enterprise | 16 dedicated | 64 GB | 360 GB | 40 TB | **$429** |
| Scale | 32 dedicated | 128 GB | 600 GB | 50 TB | **$849** |
| Mega | 48 dedicated | 192 GB | 960 GB | 60 TB | **$1,299** |
| Ultra | 96 dedicated | 384 GB | 1.9 TB | 120 TB | **$3,999** |

DigitalOcean's largest General Purpose droplet offers 40 vCPU / 160 GB RAM at $1,200/mo. Our Mega tier provides 48 vCPU / 192 GB RAM — 20% more compute — for $1,299/mo with nearly double the SSD (960 GB vs 500 GB).

## What's Included at No Extra Charge

Every Hanzo Network plan includes:
