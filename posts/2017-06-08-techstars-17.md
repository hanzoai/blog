# Hanzo Joins Techstars '17

We are excited to announce that Hanzo has been selected for the Techstars 2017 accelerator program. This marks a significant milestone in our journey to power intelligent commerce.

## Why Techstars

Techstars is not just funding. It is a network of founders, mentors, and partners who have built category-defining companies. For Hanzo, the value is:

**Mentorship**: Access to operators who have scaled commerce and AI businesses.

**Network**: Connections to potential partners, customers, and future team members.

**Validation**: External confirmation that our approach to intelligent commerce resonates.

**Resources**: Funding and infrastructure to accelerate development.

## Our Focus

During the program, we are concentrating on three areas:

### Scaling the Intelligence Layer

Our AI capabilities (recommendations, optimization, analytics) are our differentiation. We are investing heavily in:

- Model accuracy improvements
- Inference latency reduction
- New prediction capabilities

### Enterprise Readiness

Large customers require capabilities beyond our current offering:

- SOC 2 compliance
- Custom SLAs
- Dedicated infrastructure options
- Advanced access controls

### Global Expansion

Commerce is global. We are building:

- Additional payment method support
- Expanded tax compliance
- Localized experiences

## The Techstars Thesis

Techstars sees what we see: commerce is becoming intelligent. The winners will not be the platforms with the most features, but those that best understand customer behavior and optimize continuously.

Traditional commerce platforms are static. Configure once, hope for the best. Hanzo learns and adapts. Every transaction improves the system.

## What This Means for Customers

More investment in the platform. Faster feature development. Better support. And the credibility that comes from Techstars backing.

## Demo Day

We will present at Techstars Demo Day in September. If you are interested in attending or learning more about Hanzo, reach out.

Thank you to our customers, team, and supporters who made this possible. The real work is just beginning.
