# Lux Node: A New Kind of Blockchain

Today we launch Lux mainnet. After years of research and development, our vision for a better blockchain is live.

## What Makes Lux Different

### Sub-Second Finality

Bitcoin takes an hour. Ethereum takes minutes. Lux: under one second.

Traditional consensus requires nodes to agree on blocks sequentially. Lux uses repeated subsampled voting - nodes query random peers until the network reaches consensus. Finality emerges from probability, not computation.

### Multi-Chain Architecture

Lux isn't one blockchain. It's a platform for blockchains:

- **C-Chain**: EVM compatibility for smart contracts
- **X-Chain**: Native asset transfers with UTXO model
- **P-Chain**: Staking and subnet coordination
- **Subnets**: Custom blockchains with custom rules

Each chain optimized for its purpose. All secured by the same validators.

### Throughput

4,500+ transactions per second on the primary network. Unlimited with subnets - each subnet adds capacity without affecting others.

Compare:
- Bitcoin: 7 TPS
- Ethereum: 15-30 TPS
- Solana: ~3,000 TPS (but weaker finality)
- Lux: 4,500+ TPS with true finality

## The Snow* Protocol Family

Our consensus is based on metastable dynamics - systems that can tip from one state to another, like supercooled water crystallizing:

**Snowball**: Binary consensus on yes/no decisions

**Snowman**: Chain consensus for sequential blocks

**Avalanche**: DAG consensus for parallel transactions

Each protocol handles different use cases. The C-Chain uses Snowman. The X-Chain uses Avalanche.

## Why This Matters

Blockchain adoption has been limited by:

1. **Speed**: Users won't wait minutes for confirmation
2. **Cost**: High fees exclude small transactions
3. **Scalability**: Networks get slower as they grow

Lux solves all three. Fast enough for payments. Cheap enough for microtransactions. Scalable through subnets.

## What You Can Build

**DeFi**: Deploy Uniswap, Aave, Compound - any EVM protocol
**NFTs**: Mint and trade with sub-second confirmation
**Gaming**: On-chain game state without waiting
**Enterprise**: Private subnets with permissioned validators
**Interoperability**: Bridge assets from Ethereum, Bitcoin, and more

## The Road Here

2013: Forked Ethereum, started Coreth
2017: Began consensus research
2019: Added post-quantum cryptography
2020: Mainnet launch

Tens of thousands of hours of development. Formal verification of consensus. Multiple security audits. We're confident it's ready.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install the Lux CLI
brew install luxfi/tap/lux

# Create a wallet
lux wallet create

# Connect to mainnet
lux network connect mainnet
```

The future of blockchain is fast, cheap, and scalable. Welcome to Lux.
