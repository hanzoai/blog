# Now Available: Gemini 3.1 Pro

Google DeepMind released Gemini 3.1 Pro on February 19. It's live on the Hanzo AI Gateway now.

## What's New

Gemini 3.1 Pro is Google's most advanced Pro-tier model, featuring:

- **1M-token context window** — process entire codebases, long documents, or hours of transcribed audio in a single call
- **Multimodal reasoning** — text, images, audio, video, and code in one model
- **Strong benchmarks** — 77.1% on ARC-AGI-2, competitive with the best proprietary models

## Access Through Hanzo

```bash
curl https://llm.hanzo.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HANZO_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model": "google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}]}'
```

Same API, same key, zero markup. Available alongside Claude, GPT-5, DeepSeek, and our 14 Zen models.

## The 1M Context Race

With Gemini 3.1 Pro joining Zen4 Max in the 1M-token context club, developers now have multiple options for processing massive documents. Whether you need Google's multimodal breadth or Zen4 Max's intelligence, both are available through a single Hanzo API endpoint.
