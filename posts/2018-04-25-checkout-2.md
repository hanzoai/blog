# Checkout 2.0: Conversion Through Simplicity

Every percentage point of checkout conversion represents real revenue. Today we are launching Checkout 2.0, a complete redesign focused on one metric: completion rate.

## The Problem with Checkout

We analyzed 2.3 million checkout sessions across Hanzo merchants. The findings were stark:

- 68% of carts were abandoned
- Average checkout took 4.2 minutes
- Mobile conversion was 40% lower than desktop
- Payment errors caused 23% of abandonments

Checkout was where sales went to die.

## Design Principles

Checkout 2.0 follows three principles:

### 1. Remove Everything Unnecessary

We audited every field, every click, every decision point. If it did not directly contribute to completing the purchase, we removed it.

- Shipping and billing address combined by default
- Guest checkout prominent (account creation optional, post-purchase)
- Single-page layout eliminates step anxiety

### 2. Reduce Cognitive Load

Decisions slow people down. We made smart defaults:

- Shipping method pre-selected based on location and cart value
- Payment method remembered and pre-filled
- Form fields auto-formatted and validated in real-time

### 3. Eliminate Errors

Every error message is a potential abandonment:

- Address autocomplete prevents typos
- Card validation happens client-side, instantly
- Clear error messages with specific remediation

## Mobile First

Checkout 2.0 was designed mobile-first:

- Touch-optimized input fields
- Native mobile payment (Apple Pay, Google Pay) prominent
- Keyboard optimized for each field type
- Progress saves automatically

Mobile conversion in testing: up 52%.

## Technical Implementation

Checkout 2.0 is:

**Embeddable**: Drop-in component for any website

```html
<hanzo-checkout api-key="pk_live_xxx"></hanzo-checkout>
```

**Customizable**: Full CSS control, or use our themes

**Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

**Fast**: Under 50KB, loads in parallel with your page

## Results

Beta merchants saw:

- 23% increase in checkout completion
- 31% reduction in checkout time
- 45% fewer support tickets about checkout
- 52% improvement in mobile conversion

## Migration

Existing merchants can upgrade with one line change. Your current settings, payment methods, and integrations continue working.

New merchants get Checkout 2.0 by default.

## What's Next

Checkout 2.0 is the foundation. Coming soon:

- One-click checkout for returning customers
- Buy-now-pay-later integrations
- Cryptocurrency payments
- Localized checkout experiences

Every sale matters. Checkout 2.0 ensures fewer sales slip away.
