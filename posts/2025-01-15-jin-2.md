# Jin 2.0: The Next Generation of Multimodal AI

Two years ago, Jin unified our AI capabilities into a single multimodal architecture. Today we are releasing Jin 2.0, a major upgrade that expands capabilities, improves performance, and unlocks new applications.

## What's New

Jin 2.0 represents a fundamental advancement across every dimension:

### Expanded Context

| Capability | Jin 1.0 | Jin 2.0 |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Context window | 8K tokens | 128K tokens |
| Image resolution | 512x512 | 4096x4096 |
| Audio duration | 30 seconds | 10 minutes |
| Video support | None | 5 minutes |

Long-context enables new applications: entire product catalogs in context, full conversation history, complete document analysis.

### New Modalities

Jin 2.0 processes:

- **Text**: Enhanced reasoning and generation
- **Images**: Higher resolution, better understanding
- **Audio**: Speech, music, ambient sound
- **Video**: Temporal understanding across frames
- **3D**: Point clouds, meshes, spatial data
- **Code**: Execution and debugging

### Improved Reasoning

Chain-of-thought reasoning built into the model:

```
User: "Which of these products would be best for a small apartment?"
[Attaches images of 3 sofas]

Jin 2.0:
"Let me analyze each option for small apartment suitability:

1. First sofa: L-shaped sectional, approximately 120" total length
   - Would dominate a small room
   - No clear path to modular reconfiguration

2. Second sofa: Compact loveseat, approximately 60" width
   - Appropriate scale for small spaces
   - Clean lines won't visually clutter

3. Third sofa: Sleeper sofa, approximately 80" width
   - Good for multi-purpose small spaces
   - However, requires clearance for opening

Recommendation: The loveseat (#2) is best for a small apartment
prioritizing visual space. The sleeper (#3) is best if you
occasionally host guests. Avoid the sectional (#1)."
```

### Tool Use

Jin 2.0 can use external tools:

```typescript
const response = await jin.query({
  prompt: "What's the current inventory for SKU-12345?",
  tools: [
    inventoryAPI,
    orderAPI,
    shippingAPI
  ]
});

// Jin decides which tools to call, when, and how to synthesize results
```

## Architecture Evolution

### Mixture of Experts

Jin 2.0 uses a sparse MoE architecture:

```
Input
  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         Router Network          │
│  "Which experts for this input?"│
└─────────┬───────────────────────┘
          ↓
    ┌─────┼─────┬─────┬─────┐
    ↓     ↓     ↓     ↓     ↓
┌─────┐┌─────┐┌─────┐┌─────┐┌─────┐
│Exp 1││Exp 2││Exp 3││ ... ││Exp N│
└──┬──┘└──┬──┘└──┬──┘       └──┬──┘
   │      │      │             │
   └──────┴──────┴─────────────┘
          ↓
    Combined Output
```

Benefits:
- 8x more parameters with same compute
- Specialized experts for different tasks
- Dynamic routing based on input

### Native Multimodality

All modalities processed in unified space from the start:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Unified Token Space             │
│                                     │
│  [TEXT] [IMG] [IMG] [AUDIO] [TEXT]  │
│    ↕     ↕     ↕      ↕      ↕      │
│  Cross-attention across all tokens  │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

No more separate encoders merged late. True multimodal understanding.

### Memory and Retrieval

Built-in retrieval augmentation:

```typescript
const jin = new Jin({
  memory: {
    type: 'hybrid',
    shortTerm: 'conversation',
    longTerm: 'vector_store',
    retrieval: 'automatic'
  }
});

// Jin automatically retrieves relevant context
const response = await jin.query({
  prompt: "What did the customer say about sizing in their last order?"
  // Jin retrieves from long-term memory automatically
});
```

## Performance

### Speed

| Metric | Jin 1.0 | Jin 2.0 | Improvement |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Time to first token | 450ms | 120ms | 73% faster |
| Tokens per second | 45 | 180 | 4x faster |
| Image processing | 800ms | 200ms | 75% faster |

### Quality

Benchmarks on commerce tasks:

| Task | Jin 1.0 | Jin 2.0 | Improvement |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Product understanding | 84% | 93% | +9% |
| Customer intent | 79% | 91% | +12% |
| Recommendation relevance | 71% | 86% | +15% |
| Support resolution | 67% | 84% | +17% |

## API Changes

### New Capabilities

```typescript
// Video understanding
const analysis = await jin.analyze({
  video: productDemoVideo,
  prompt: "Summarize the key features demonstrated"
});

// Tool use
const result = await jin.query({
  prompt: "Check inventory and create a restock order if needed",
  tools: [inventoryTool, orderTool],
  autoExecute: true
});

// Long context
const summary = await jin.query({
  documents: entireProductCatalog, // 100K+ tokens
  prompt: "Which products would appeal to eco-conscious millennials?"
});
```

### Backward Compatibility

Jin 1.0 API calls work unchanged. New capabilities opt-in.

## Deployment Options

### Cloud

Available now on Hanzo Cloud:

```typescript
const jin = new Jin({
  apiKey: 'xxx',
  model: 'jin-2.0'
});
```

### Self-Hosted

- Minimum: 8x H100 GPUs
- Recommended: 16x H100 GPUs
- Quantized: 4x H100 GPUs (reduced quality)

### Edge

- Video: $0.05 per minute

Volume discounts available.

## Migration

### Recommended Path

1. Test Jin 2.0 with existing prompts
2. Enable new capabilities incrementally
3. Update prompts to leverage improvements
4. Monitor quality and adjust

### Timeline

## What's Next

Jin 2.0 is the foundation for:

- Real-time video understanding
- Autonomous agent capabilities
- Personalized model adaptation
- Cross-lingual commerce

The future of commerce AI starts today.
